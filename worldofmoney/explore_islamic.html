<b>ISLAMIC COINS</b>
<p>
Early Islamic Coins
<p>
After the rise of Islam in Arabia in the 7th century AD, the early Muslims used, adapted and imitated the coinage of the peoples whose lands they had conquered. They inherited two principal monetary systems.
The former Byzantine territories had a gold-based currency, the solidus, and a bronze  coinage, the follis.   The Sasanians had a coinage based on the silver drachm. The Muslims adapted the names of the coin types: �denarius� became �dinar�, �follis� became �fals� and �drachm� became �dirham�.
<p>
<b>Words of Muhammad</b>
<p>
In AD 696-7 the coinage underwent a reform which ended the use of figural representation, particularly on  gold and silver coins. From then on inscriptions became dominant.
These stated the essence of the Islamic message: the belief in the one God, Allah, and that Muhammad was his messenger. These are phrases known as the shahada, or �profession of faith�.

<b>Standardised coins</b>
<p>
The shahada, along with reference to the mint, date and later to the ruler, provided for several centuries the standard for Islamic coins struck across the empire. This stretched, at its height, from Spain in the west to India in the east.
The  main language found on Islamic coins was Arabic which, being associated with the Qur'an, was greatly revered.  On coins up to the 13th century the script used was known as Kufic and is characterised by angular letter forms.<p>
