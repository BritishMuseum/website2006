<B>WHAT IS MONEY?</B><P></P>
Money has been used in different forms all over the world for over 5,000 years. 
Uses and forms far in the past and in distant lands may not always be obvious to us. 
We can define money by seeing how it is used or by looking at all the different forms it has taken.

<B>Forms of Money</B><BR>
The forms that different peoples have adopted or adapted for their money can tell us much about the nature of money and the history of its use. Some forms are familiar to us today. Their origins are not always as straightforward as we might think, however. 
Some forms of money are completely unfamiliar. They may look weird and wonderful to our eyes. Or, like the axe,  they might look quite familiar, but it simply would not occur to us that they could have been used as money.
<P></P>
<B>Familiar Forms</B><BR>
A wide variety of monetary forms are in use in the Western world today. Each of these forms has a different history. 
Banks and governments store their reserves as ingots of gold. Loose change jingles in all our pockets and purses. Banknotes and cheque books provide a light-weight, convenient alternative spending-power. Increasingly we are entering a 'cashless society' where plastic cards offer instant credit, or remove money from bank accounts through telephone lines.

<B>Unfamiliar Forms</B><BR>
Why do different peoples give monetary value to different objects? What is it about those objects that makes them suitable for that purpose? 
In some cases it may be a social reason connected with a particular society's idea of attractiveness and value. For others there may a religious or philosophical reason behind the form chosen. Some societies have allowed consumable products to take on a monetary role. Others have opted for more functional objects.
<P></P>
<B>Uses of Money</B><BR>
Money has value. Everyone who uses a particular form of money must agree on that value, and agree to respect that value. Once a group of people agree on something to use as money, and on the value it carries, then a whole range of possibilities opens up. 
Some uses are obvious, and were perhaps among the reasons why money was created. Others are less obvious, and reveal how different societies approach money in different ways.
