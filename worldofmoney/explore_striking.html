<b>BLANKS</b>
<p>
The striking of a coin between dies was the end of a long process.  Precious metal of the correct alloy needed to be produced, then turned into blanks.  Ingots were beaten flat into sheets, and the blanks cut out with shears or with a tool like a pastry cutter.
<p>
Some blanks were created round by being sawn off a circular ingot; or by sieving molten metal to produce round blobs or discs.  These techniques required extra work with the hammer to ensure the blanks were properly thin and round.

<b>DIES</b>
<p>
Dies were made of iron, with steel faces.  Surviving medieval examples show that the two sorts of die, upper and lower, had different shapes.  The lower die was more solid, and had a spike on the bottom so it could be embedded into a stable surface.
<p>
The upper die, which was held in the hand, was lighter and thinner, and hammer-blows soon gave its top a mushroom-like appearance.  Because the upper die took the brunt of the blow, it usually carried the less important design, with the front design on the lower die.
