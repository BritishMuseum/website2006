<B>MONEY AND SOCIETY</B><P></P>
Money affects how we live in many different ways. 
Rulers and governments raise and spend money on behalf of the state.
Money also affects us as individuals. 
We use it to pay for entertainment, as well as for the necessities of life.

<B>Money and Entertainment</B><BR>
Money is often linked with entertainment. Sometimes this is because of what money can do. It allows people to buy things they want to have, or to pay to go to a concert or football match.
Money can also be a source of entertainment in itself. The idea of wealth is seen as very attractive, and many sorts of entertainment are based on this idea. Many people enjoy watching game shows with big cash prizes, even though they do not stand to become rich just by watching.
<P></P>
<B>Display of Wealth</B><BR>
Much of the attraction of money comes from the way it can be used to acquire power, material comfort or social status. Many people, both rulers and individuals, have felt that the display of this wealth improves their position.
In many societies people have been reluctant to show off personal wealth, because of moral objections to moneymaking. For this reason, wealth is frequently displayed indirectly, for example by erecting a magnificent building rather than flaunting a great heap of coins or banknotes.

<B>Money and Belief</B><BR>
Money and religious beliefs are both central to how society works. Religion provides a moral framework for how we behave, while economic theories also provide a pattern for behaviour.
Money and belief do not necessarily conflict. The giving of money plays an important part in a variety of rituals, and the power of many religions has been built in part on their wealth. However,   most religions have been concerned about the moral implications of the use of money.

<B>Money and War</B><BR>
Warfare rarely occurs without the involvement of money. Troops have to be paid, weapons and provisions bought. The effects of war also have their costs, both in repairs to physical damage, and in damage to the economy caused by the instability of war.
War also affects the way we use money. People may save their money rather than spend it, prices may rise because of shortages of goods and labour, and unusual types of money have to be created to provide for temporary emergencies.

<B>Money and Politics</B><BR>
Money and politics have always been closely linked. In many political systems, political power has been restricted to the wealthy. Equally, political authority has also been an opportunity for people to get rich personally, while working for the state.
A large part of government is concerned with money. Taxes or tribute are paid to the government, which then pays out money on defence, hospitals, and other services. Political theories are increasingly linked to theories of how money works.
<P></P>
<B>Money and Art</B><BR>
Money and art are connected in many ways. Coins and banknotes have often carried designs of a high artistic standard. The use of money, and its impact on society, have also provided a popular subject for paintings.
<P></P>Art is also closely tied to money through patronage. Artists have often depended on financial support, and sometimes the form of works of art is dictated by what the artist feels will sell. Art works are also sometimes bought as a form of financial investment.
