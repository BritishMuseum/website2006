<B>STUDYING MONEY</B><P></P>
Coins have a history of over 2,500 years. Having been mass produced and made of metal 
they survive in large quantities. As a result they often throw valuable light on the nations 
and rulers who have made and used them since then.<P></P>

<B>Numismatists</B><BR>
The word 'numismatist' comes from the Greek <I>nomisma</I> meaning 'coin'. 
A numismatist, therefore, is somebody who studies coins and other types of money, 
usually from an archaeological and historical standpoint.<P></P>
Coins are one of the most important sources of information from which 
archaeologists and historians can try to interpret the past. This is partly because, 
unlike most other ancient artefacts, they are often stamped with words and images. 
It is also because they are hard-wearing and survive in large numbers.
<P></P>
<B>Historians</B><BR>
Unlike most objects studied by historians, coins were officially produced by the state 
rather than privately made by individuals. This means the type of information 
they can give is often different from that provided by other artefacts. 
Their designs and inscriptions are an unrivalled source of detailed 
information about political history, religion and culture. And their role as the 
main form of money over the past 2,000 years means that they can tell us about 
economies for which we have little or no written evidence.

We know that he ruled from AD 69-79, so finding coins such as these can help to date archaeological sites.

<B>Archaeologists</B><BR>
Coins are one of the most commonly found archaeological objects. 
Millions of coins survive from past societies dating back over 2,500 years. 
Being made of metal, coins have tended to survive much better than less durable objects. 
In addition, because they are valuable, they have often been concealed for safe keeping 
in hoards.
<P></P>
Crucial to the interpretation of coins is the fact that most can be dated. 
Their high survival rate and their official inscriptions make them the most easily 
and most accurately datable of all archaeological artefacts.
