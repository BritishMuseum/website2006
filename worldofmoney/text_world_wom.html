<b>HISTORY OF MONEY</b><p></p>
The World of Money CD-ROM explores the whole range of money across all 
regions of the globe, from its very earliest forms to its future in the twenty-first century. 
Here we look at the first coins.

It is from Lydia (in modern Turkey) and dates from about 650-600 BC.

The Greek historian Herodotus, writing in the 5th century BC famously stated that 'the Lydians were the first people we know to have struck and used coinage of silver and gold.' He is almost correct.
The earliest coins were in fact made from electrum, an alloy of gold and silver but, on the evidence of their findspots, do seem to belong to this part of the world. These coins had a design on one side only. On the other, simple punches were used.
<p></p>
<b>The Earliest Coin Hoard</b><br>
The earliest known hoard of electrum coins (and thus the earliest known coin hoard) was found buried in a small pot during the British Museum's excavations of the Artemision, or Temple of Artemis at Ephesus in 1904-5.
Containing 19 coins it had been placed alongside another 74 coins in the foundations of the temple, one of the seven wonders of the ancient world, in about 600 BC.

<b>A Strict Weight System</b><br>
Although irregular in size and shape, these early electrum coins were minted according to a strict weight-standard. The denominations ranged from 1 stater (weighing about 14.1g) down through half-staters, thirds, sixths, twelfths, 1/24ths and 1/48ths to 1/96th stater (about 0.15gm).
It cannot have been easy to tell some of the smaller denominations apart. We must assume that for many transactions the coins were weighed rather than counted.
<p></p>
<b>The Spread of Electrum Coinage</b><br>
From Lydia electrum coinage soon spread to the Greek cities of coastal Asia Minor. From there it reached the Greeks of the islands and the mainland. It is often difficult to tell where a particular coin was produced, because none of these early coins was inscribed with a place-name.
Educated guesses are possible, however. One type of coin has the design of a seal on its obverse. The Greek for seal is 'phoce' and the coins are usually attributed to the Greek city of Phocaea.

<b>Names on Electrum Coins</b><br>
Some of the earliest Lydian electrum coins are inscribed with names in ancient Lydian script. Two individuals are known: Walwel and Kalil. It is unclear whether these are names of kings or just rich men who produced the earliest coins.
The earliest legend in Greek on an electrum coin reads 'I am the badge of Phanes'. We cannot be certain who this Phanes was, but it seems that he was placing his badge on coins as a guarantee of their quality.
