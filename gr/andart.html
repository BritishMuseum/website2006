        <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#000066"><strong>Why 
          the British Museum cannot and does not want to lend its Sculptures of 
          the Parthenon</strong></font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In 2003 the British 
          Museum will celebrate its 250th anniversary. Though the Museum has undergone 
          many changes, the most recent being the creation of its publicly acclaimed 
          Great Court, there remains a single presiding purpose, namely to provide 
          knowledge freely to any that seek it. Many millions of people from all 
          over the world have found enjoyment and meaning in the galleries and 
          study rooms of the Museum, and many generations of curators have been 
          privileged to serve them. </font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The unique experience 
          that the British Museum and a few other museums like it can offer, depends 
          directly upon the diversity of the cultures, ancient and modern, it 
          represents. The British Museum transcends national boundaries. It has 
          never been, in spite of its name, a museum of British culture; it is 
          a museum of the world, and its purpose is to display the works of mankind 
          of all periods and of all places. Such an encyclopaedic assemblage reveals 
          the cultural exchange that took place between civilisations of the past, 
          which is the legacy of the present. The idea of cultural restitution 
          is the anathema of this principle.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> The British Museum 
          holds no place for nationalism. In any case, today's national boundaries 
          and cultural mixes bear little relation to the ancient past. The restitutionist 
          premise, that whatever was made in a country must return to an original 
          geographical site, would empty both the British Museum and the other 
          great museums of the world. </font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The idea of a universal 
          museum is the outcome of the eighteenth-century age of enlightenment 
          when curiosity was fostered in all branches of art and science. The 
          collections of the British Museum were often assembled by talented individuals 
          who saw the value of the objects they acquired before others had learned 
          to appreciate them. They include Thomas Bruce, 7th Earl of Elgin, who 
          has been unjustly defamed by the campaign for the restitution of the 
          Elgin marbles, but who deserves his place in history along with other 
          diplomats whose collections came to the Museum. Such men saw their embassies 
          abroad as opportunities to promote public understanding at home of the 
          ancient and modern cultures they encountered on their travels. </font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Parthenon known 
          to Elgin had been turned into a ruin at the end of the 17th century 
          by an explosion caused by a Venetian shell. We are indebted to Elgin 
          for having rescued the Parthenon sculptures and others from the Acropolis 
          from the destruction they were suffering, as well as from the damage 
          that the Acropolis monuments, including the sculptures that he did not 
          remove, have suffered since. </font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Parthenon sculptures 
          are now one of the greatest treasures of the British Museum and they 
          have been the heart of its classical collections since they were acquired 
          in 1816. The gallery in which they are housed has been described as 
          "one of the central places of earth". They are among a select number 
          of objects in the Museum that are intrinsic to its identity. Inevitably, 
          there are occasional requests to lend some of these objects to exhibitions 
          abroad. The Museum has a very generous loans policy, but the Trustees 
          are determined that such loans should not deprive visitors of the chance 
          to see objects that are famously part of the Museum's collections, which 
          they may reasonably expect to see on display when they come, and which 
          offer the public an overall sense of the past.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> There has been 
          speculation recently as to whether for the Olympic year of 2004, the 
          Museum might agree to lend the Parthenon sculptures for exhibition in 
          Athens. It is normal courtesy that such loan requests are addressed 
          first to the Museum Director, but so far no such request has been received. 
          Instead, there are press reports that a Museum is being constructed 
          in Athens, designed especially to house the British Museum's own sculptures. 
          No mention is made in these reports of the urgent need in Athens of 
          a proper building for displaying the many sculptures of the Parthenon 
          and other treasures that are currently lumbered in store rooms. These 
          include fourteen blocks of the west frieze that were removed, much damaged 
          by weathering, from the Parthenon in 1993 and have not been seen by 
          the public since then. Other sculptures are currently left on the building 
          and suffer the same damage. If symbolic gestures for 2004 are called 
          for, there could be none better than Greece making sure that it properly 
          displays what it already has.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Meanwhile, the 
          British Museum's sculptures are where they will remain, in the Museum's 
          own purpose-built gallery, where they are displayed free for all. The 
          Museum has always regarded it as a privilege to display some of the 
          finest artworks known to mankind and has a responsibility to promote 
          public understanding of them, which it does through exhibitions, publications 
          and many educational programmes. The first responsibility of the Museum 
          is, however, to keep the objects in its care safe for present and future 
          generations. The collections of the Museum are safeguarded against any 
          attempt to dispose of them by far-sighted legislation. This affects 
          not only items of the first significance such as the Parthenon sculptures, 
          but every object that is registered as part of the collection. The Museum 
          owns its collections, but its Trustees are not empowered to dispose 
          of them. This limit on their powers extends to loans, where there could 
          be no guarantee of an object being returned. </font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Greece has recently 
          given up previous attempts to challenge the British Museum's legal ownership, 
          which is in any case unassailable, but still seeks possession of them 
          by attempting to pressure the Museum into agreeing to a loan. The Museum 
          has neither the power to agree to such a loan nor does it wish to offer 
          its assent to a proposal which is transparently against the interests 
          of the many visitors who flock to the British Museum from all over the 
          world and is contrary to the liberal principles which the museum serves.
