        the British Museum at the beginning of the year 1817, the marbles were 
        first housed in a prefabricated gallery designed by Robert Smirke. A permanent 
        'Elgin Room' was constructed on the west side of the Museum in 1832, and 
        the collection remained there until the Duveen Gallery was built.<br>

      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">4.2. This building 
        was specially designed to house the Parthenon Sculptures. It was funded 
        by Lord Duveen and designed by the architect John Russell Pope. The building 
        was completed in 1938, but the outbreak of war in 1939 postponed installation.<br>
        </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">4.3.During the Second 
        World War the sculptures were fully protected. The frieze was removed 
        to an unused section of the London Underground Railway and the pedimental 
        figures and the metopes were taken down to the Museum vaults. The Duveen 
        Gallery itself was seriously damaged in 1940. Following repair work, and 
        the addition of an electrostatic precipitator for <br>
        cleaning the air the gallery was opened in 1962.<br>

        on the building, a full-scale reconstruction of the upper part of the 
        north-west corner of the building, new audio guides and a special programme 
        for visually impaired visitors. In 2001 a special &quot;touch-model&quot; 
        of the Parthenon was added and additions made to the audio guides. In 
        2004 new information panels and objects charting the later history of

      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><strong>5. The Cleaning 
        of the Parthenon Sculptures in 1938</strong></font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">5.1. In early 1939 
        there was considerable press interest in a revelation that during the 
        process of cleaning the Parthenon sculptures for display in the newly 
        constructed Duveen Gallery unauthorised methods were used. Contemporary 
        reports, both official and unofficial, indicate that copper chisels and 
        carborundum were used in addition to the recommended water and <br>
        soap on some of the sculptures over a period of fifteen months. The British 
        Museum held an internal enquiry and as a result the Keeper, F.N. Pryce, 
        took early retirement, a young Assistant Keeper, Roger Hinks, resigned, 
        and all the craftsmen concerned left the Museum's employ.<br>
        </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">5.2. . There were 
        questions in Parliament and the Trustees resolved to publish a full report 
        on the effects of the cleaning, but the outbreak of war intervened. After 
        the war, the sculptures did not emerge from storage until 1949, by which 
        time most observers were happy to herald them as a symbol of the regeneration 
        of post-war Britain. In 1950, however, Cesare Brandi, head of the Institute 
        of Restoration in Rome, published an article critical of the cleaning. 
        There was, surprisingly perhaps, no further published response on the 
        part of the academic community, either to the cleaning or to Brandi's 
        article, until 1984, when the private diaries of Roger Hinks and the Earl 
        of Crawford (a former Trustee) were published posthumously. In the same 
        year full reference to the cleaning was made in the Greek demand for the 
        return of the Parthenon sculptures through UNESCO. The issue was also 
        discussed by the journalist Christopher <br>
        Hitchens in his book The Elgin Marbles - should they be returned to Greece? 
        (1987).<br>
        </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">5.3.. In 1996 William 
        St Clair renewed his request to see restricted papers detailing the 1930s 
        cleaning. Privileged access was granted, and he made extensive use of 
        them in a chapter of the third edition of his book, Lord Elgin &amp; the 
        Marbles (1998). St Clair called for an international enquiry into the 
        cleaning and the Museum's handling of it.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">5.4. The Museum replied 
        by announcing a scholarly conference in its series of Classical Colloquia 
        and inviting Mr. St. Clair and a team of Greek experts from the Acropolis 
        to present papers. The conference took place on November 30th and December 
        1st 1999 and addressed the visual and documentary evidence for the cleaning 
        with the aim of determining how and <br>
        to what extent the surface of the sculptures may have changed. In so doing, 
        attention was also drawn to a similar cleaning in 1953, using steel chisels 
        and brass wire brushes, of the sculptures on the Parthenon's sister temple 
        in Athens, the Hephaisteion. The conference also looked at wider issues 
        concerning the history and ideas of conservation. For the evidence see

        by publishing scholarly and popular books and articles, and in facilitating 
        the studies of others through access to the unique collection of books, 
        photographs, manuscripts, drawings and plaster casts. As part of this 
        commitment, the Museum maintains close links with the Centre for <br>
        Acropolis Studies in Athens. It has advised on and in a number of ways 
        facilitated the current programme of Conservation of Acropolis Monuments. 
        In 1985 it hosted a special exhibition on the conservation programme on 
        the Acropolis. There have been several recent exchanges of plaster casts 
        and the leading architectural historian of the Parthenon, Professor Manolis 
        Korres, advised on the new model of the Acropolis specially made in Greece 
        for the British Museum in 1998. The Museum holds the work of its colleagues 
        in the Greek Archaeological Service in very high regard and will continue 
        to promote good relations with them.<br>

        for the Return of the Parthenon Sculptures</strong></font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">7.1. The suggestion 
        that the Parthenon sculptures be returned to Athens is not new. Such a 
        possibility was first mooted in Britain by Hugh Hammersley MP in the House 
        of Commons debate of 7 June 1816. Calls for their return from individual 
        Greeks began in 1833. In 1965 the Greek Minister of Culture went so far 
        as to call for the return of all Greek antiquities to Greece. After the 
        fall of the military dictatorship in 1974, the Parthenon Sculptures began 
        to take on a new role as a symbol of the revived democracy and from 1982 
        this was championed by the late Melina Mercouri as Greek Minister of Culture. 
        Ever since, the return of the Parthenon Sculptures in London has been 
        a feature of Greek Government policy, national and international. <br>
        </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">7.2. . At the UNESCO 
        World Conference on Cultural Policies in Mexico of 1982, at Ms Mercouri's 
        instigation, a vote on a resolution calling for the return of the Parthenon 
        marbles and their reincorporation on the building was passed, although 
        there were many abstentions, including Italy and France, and many absentees. 
        In October 1983 a formal bilateral request for the return was made by 
        the Greek Government to the British Government- the first ever made. Following 
        discussion with the Director and Trustees of the British Museum, this 
        request was formally rejected by the British Government in April 1984. 
        It was followed in September by a further submission of a claim through 
        UNESCO, which was similarly rejected in 1985, after consultation with 
        the British Museum. Successive British governments have held the position 
        that this is a matter for the Museum's Trustees who are the legal owners 
        of the Parthenon Sculptures.<br>
        </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">7.3. In May 1997, 
        following a further direct appeal by the Greek government, the then Secretary 
        of State in the Department for Culture Media and Sport, the Rt. Hon. Chris 
        Smith MP, affirmed the Government's position that the issue was a matter 
        for the Trustees of the British Museum and that the Government would not 
        seek to have them returned to Greece. This is still the policy of the 
        British Government. <br>
        </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">7.4. . In October 
        1999 the Culture, Media and Sport Committee of the House of Commons announced 
        its intention to conduct an enquiry into the return of cultural property 
        and the illicit trade. Following the submission of written evidence and 
        visits to the British Museum, Greece and Italy the Committee held oral 
        sessions, at one of which the Greek Foreign Minister, <br>
        Mr. George Papandreou, presented the Greek position. The full report was 
        published in March 2000 and the Select Committee advocated no change to 
        the present status of the Parthenon Sculptures in the British Museum.<br>
        </font></p>
      <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> 7.5. This position 
        has been reinforced by subsequent cross-party statements, by letters to 
        the British Committee for the Restitution of the Parthenon Sculptures 
        and MEPs from the former Minister for the Arts, the Rt. Hon Alan Howarth, 
        and by the Prime Minister, the Rt. Hon. Tony Blair, in an interview with 
        the Greek newspaper To Bima (March 2001).</font></p>

        7.6 In November 2002 Evangelos Venizelos, Greek Minister of Culture, came 
        with a delegation to meet Sir Jon Boyd, Chairman of the Trustees of the 
        British Museum, and Neil MacGregor, the Director, to present for the first 
        time to the Museum a proposal that the Parthenon Sculptures in the British 
        Museum should be removed to Athens to a new museum being built near the 
        Acropolis, either as a long term loan or as an annex of the British Museum. 
        This proposal was elaborated at a UNESCO committee meeting in March 203, 
        with the addition of a linkage with the forthcoming Athens Olympics of 
        August 2004.</font></p>
      <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The issue of the British 
        Museum's ownership of the sculptures, which was long disputed by the Greek 
        Government, was said in 2000 to have been put to one side. However, not 
        only was a private legal action begun in the UK following a visit of the 
        Greek Minister of Shipping, but in a letter to the Sunday Times of 17th 
        August 2003 Mr Venizelos confirmed that the Greek Government does not 
        acknowledge that the Trustees of the British Museum own the Parthenon 
        Sculptures in the Museum's collection. Given this fact alone, the Trustees 
        and Director have said that they were unable to consider discussing a 
        loan. Quite apart from this, however, the Trustees also have to consider 
        issues of conservation, the safety of transporting such large and fragile 
        objects and the impact on the visitors to the British Museum. No formal 
        request for any precisely defined loan of the Sculptures has ever been 
        received by the Trustees of the British Museum.</font></p>

        (see Times 18th October) a television company recorded Prime Minister

        forthcoming General Election, now set to take place on 7 March.<br>

      <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">8.1.The British Museum 
      has a long history of collaboration with Greek colleagues in Athens throughout 
      the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. Indeed, the modern understanding 
      of the Parthenon and its sculptures is based on just this. Recent collaboration 
      has taken place with Professor Korres in connection with a new model of 
      the Acropolis and Dr. Alexandros <br>
      Mantis, the senior Greek scholar of the Parthenon sculptures, has spent 
      two months in the British Museum studying the sculptures on a British School 
      at Athens Bursary. In addition, there was much mutual exchange of information 
      on conservation issues at the time of the international conference on the 
      1938 Cleaning.<br>
      <br wp="BR1">
      </font> 
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">8.2. . The collaboration 
        may also be charted by the British Museum's repeated supply of casts to 
        Athens. In 1844-46, a full set of plaster casts of the sculptures of the 
        Parthenon were presented, together with cement casts of the Caryatid, 
        architectural pieces from the Erechtheion and reliefs from the Temple 
        of Athena Nike. Similar gifts occurred in 1912 <br>
        and in 1932. Between 1976 and 1978 various moulds and casts were provided 
        for the new Committee for the Preservation of Acropolis Monuments. Further 
        presentations of casts have taken place between 1993 and 2000, both of 
        material in the British Museum and elsewhere, while facilities were provided 
        for a Greek technician to make moulds from casts in the British <br>
        Museum of the whole of the west frieze of the Parthenon for the production 
        of cement casts to go on the building.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">8.3 The British Museum 
        also seeks to collaborate with its Greek colleagues in the widest possible 
        manner by organising special lectures in London for them (e.g. senior 
        Greek scholars like Drs. Yalouris, Trianti, Demakopoulou and Choremi) 
        and by encouraging their participation in conferences in the British Museum. 
        Most recently, in November 2003, the Museum held a major international 
        conference entitled After Actium which concentrated on new discoveries 
        from the Roman period, at which 15 distinguished Greek archaeologists 
        spoke, including Prof. Dimitrios Pandermalis, President of the Organization 
        for the Construction of the New Acropolis Museum.<br>

        <br>
        </font><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In the 19th 
        century the term 'Elgin Marbles' was used for the contents of the Elgin 
        Saloon, i.e. the entire Elgin Collection. It has also been used popularly 
        to describe the Parthenon sculptures. The Museum term, as carved on the 
        wall of the Duveen Gallery, is 'The Sculptures of the Parthenon'.</font></p>
      <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> 9.2. The collection 
        was &quot;stolen&quot; by Lord Elgin</font></p>
      <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> 9.2.1. Lord Elgin 
        took up his post as Ambassador to the Sublime Porte (Constantinople) in 
        1799. Greece was then part of the Ottoman Empire and had been since 1453. 
        (The Greek War of Independence started in 1821 and Greece became independent 
        in 1829).</font></p>
      <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> 9.2.2. Elgin's intention 
        was to improve the arts of Great Britain by making available casts and 
        drawings of Greek monuments previously known only from drawings and engravings. 
        To this end, he assembled a group of architects, painters, draughtsmen 
        and moulders under the Italian G.B. Lusieri, which began work in Athens 
        in 1800.</font></p>
      <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> 9.2.3. The continuing 
        destruction of classical sculptures in Athens, however, persuaded Elgin 
        to endeavour to remove for posterity what sculptures he could. In 1801 
        he was granted a firman (licence) as a diplomatic gesture in gratitude 
        for Britain's firm stance against the presence of French forces in Egypt, 
        then an Ottoman possession. The firman required the Turkish authorities 
        in Athens not to hinder Elgin's employees in their drawing, modelling, 
        erection of scaffolding and also allowed them to &quot;take away any pieces 
        of stone with inscriptions or figures&quot;. The presentation of this 
        firman to the local authorities in Athens was accompanied by a designated 
        official from Constantinople (a mubashir who out-ranked all the local 
        officers) and he participated in its application. Lord Elgin's work was 
        carried out openly and with the support of local officials both Turkish 
        and Greek between 1801 and1804. A final firman was secured by Sir Robert 
        Adair (Ambassador in Constantinople) in February 1810, from the same authority 
        as the earlier firman, that instructed the authorities in Athens to allow 
        the embarkation of all the remaining antiquities collected by Lord Elgin.</font></p>
      <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> 9.2.4. The opinion 
        of the 1816 Select Committee of the House of Commons, after examining 
        a series of witnesses, was that Elgin had acted with the permission of 
        the Turkish authorities, and as a private individual (although it was 
        suggested that such powers might only have been given to an Ambassador).</font></p>
      <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> 9.3. Lord Elgin &quot;bought&quot; 
        the marbles, using &quot;bribery, pressure and corruption.&quot;</font></p>
      <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> The firman was granted 
        in 1801 as a diplomatic gesture. The money expended by Elgin was largely 
        on the salaries of his team, on transport and on the recovery of a consignment 
        that sank off Kythera. Presents were given to the Turkish officials in 
        Athens according to the custom of the times and in the case of the sculptures 
        the total did not exceed &pound;600. Elgin presented his full accounts 
        to the Parliamentary Select Committee in 1816.</font></p>
      <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> 9.4. &quot;More damage 
        was done to the Parthenon in 1801-2 than in the previous <br>
        2,200 years&quot; (Melina Mercouri, The Times, 15.1.83)</font></p>
      <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> 9.4.1. This is untrue. 
        The worst damage to the structure occurred in 1687 when a Turkish powder-magazine 
        in the temple exploded after a direct hit by the besieging Venetians. 
        Previously the Parthenon was almost complete as a structure; afterwards 
        it was a ruin.</font></p>
      <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> 9.4.2. Significant 
        earlier damage to the structure resulted from the conversion of the temple 
        into a Christian church about AD 450, including the construction of an 
        apse at the east end. At this time the sculptures of the Parthenon suffered 
        their worst calamity in history. The whole of the <br>
        middle section of the east pediment was removed, entailing the destruction 
        of a dozen statues in all; part of the east frieze was taken down to enable 
        the apse to be built and the heads vandalised; and almost all of the metopes 
        on the east, north and west sides of the Temple were <br>
        deliberately defaced. Compared to this, only minimal damage was inflicted 
        on the building by Elgin's agents in removing some of the remaining sculptures 
        from further risk, and none of this was to the sculptures themselves.</font></p>
      <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> 9.4.3. Furthermore, 
        the sculptures left by Elgin have greatly deteriorated since the early 
        19th century and this destruction was noticed to have accelerated as early 
        as the 1920s, with the immense growth of Athens, accompanied by industrial 
        pollution and increasing motor traffic. As a Greek scholar commented after 
        the remaining pedimental sculptures were lifted down in 1977, &quot;the 
        industrial pollution of modern Athens had wreaked havoc upon their delicate 
        surface&quot;. Similar observations were made in a recent report by a 
        Greek team of archaeologists and conservators following the eventual removal 
        of the slabs of the west frieze in 1993. It <br>
        is tragic, therefore, that some sculptures (including the metope at the 
        extreme west end of the south side, which was once the very finest and 
        best preserved of all) are still on the building.</font></p>
      <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> 9.4.4. Finally, the 
        stability of the Parthenon itself and the condition of all its parts were 
        greatly endangered by the restoration work carried out by Nikolaos Balanos 
        in the 1920s and 1930s, especially through his use of iron bars that have 
        now corroded and swollen, causing the marble to split and shatter. This 
        use of iron bars, unprotected by lead casings, ran counter not only to 
        contemporary conservation practice but even to ancient Greek methods of 
        construction. Balanos' work has in recent years been firmly condemned 
        by Greek experts. For example, in 1994 Charalambos Bouras (Architect to 
        the Committee for the Conservation of the Acropolis <br>
        Monuments) described the work of Balanos (in The Parthenon and its Impact 
        on Modern Times) as &quot;truly catastrophic for the monuments&quot; and 
        a &quot;terrible disaster&quot;.</font></p>
      <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> 9.5. &quot;Part of 
        the collection was lost at sea&quot;</font></p>
      <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> There was a consignment 
        of 17 crates on Elgin's ship &quot;Mentor&quot; when it sank off the island 
        of Kythera. Every single crate, however, was salvaged at Elgin's expense 
        and nothing was lost.</font></p>
      <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> 9.6. Lord Elgin &quot;sold&quot; 
        the marbles to the British Government<br>
        </font></p>
      <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> This is untrue. Although 
        from 1803 it had been Elgin's declared intention to present the sculptures 
        to the nation, on his return to England in 1806, following imprisonment 
        by the French, he was afflicted with severe financial problems. In 1810 
        he began informal negotiations with the Government for the sale of his 
        collection. In 1815 the collection was eventually offered <br>
        for &pound;73,600 (representing his costs and 12 years' interest, but 
        not the value of the sculptures) with the proposal that, if this were 
        refused, Elgin would abide by the value to be determined by a special 
        Committee of the House of Commons. The Committee held that the value of 
        the collection was &pound;35,000 - a valuation which Elgin had no option 
        but to accept - and <br>
        because of his financial problems the sale went through. The British Museum 
        purchased the sculptures from Lord Elgin with a grant of funds agreed 
        by Parliament.</font></p>
      <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> 9.7. &quot;The marbles 
        would look much better on the building for which they were intended&quot;</font></p>
      <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> 9.7.1. It is now 
        universally agreed by all parties that the remaining sculptures cannot 
        be repositioned on the Parthenon itself. The building is an unprotected 
        ruin liable to damage both from earthquake and from environmental conditions, 
        including weathering and pollution</font></p>
      <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> 9.7.2. The stafff 
        of the Greek Archaeological Service long ago realised that the sculptures 
        on the Parthenon needed protection from the elements and in particular 
        from the polluted air of modern Athens. Nevertheless, it is true that 
        not even now have all of the architectural sculptures been removed from 
        the Parthenon to exhibition or storage in the Acropolis <br>
        Museum in fulfilment of plans announced in September 1983 by the Committee 
        <br>
        for the Preservation of the Acropolis Monuments. These plans envisaged 
        the <br>
        substitution of casts for all the sculptures once on the building.</font></p>
      <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> 9.8. &quot;In Athens 
        a new museum has been built to accommodate the marbles&quot; <br>
        (Isabel Hilton, Guardian 10.11.99)</font></p>
      <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> 9.8.1.. In May 1989 
        Melina Mercouri announced an international competition for the siting 
        and planning of a new museum to house the material from the Acropolis 
        (similar competitions were held in 1976 and 1979). In 1990 the first prize 
        was awarded to the Italian architects Lucio Passarelli and Manfredi Nicoletti 
        and a completion date of 1996 announced. Argument between the political 
        parties, however, overturned the result. Problems were also encountered 
        in <br>
        purchasing the required land. When archaeological excavation of the site 
        eventually began, it revealed extremely important new information on the 
        city of Athens in Late Antiquity.</font></p>
      <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> 9.8.2. In November 
        1999, the Greek Government announced a new architectural competition, 
        with the intention of preserving the archaeological remains below the 
        new Museum. In late September 2001 the winner was announced (Tschumi and 
        Photiades). Construction work began in 2002, destroying unpublished archaeological 
        remains. In autumn 2003 the Greek Supreme Court ruled that the building 
        was illegal. The Greek Government has, nevertheless, consistently maintained 
        that the new Museum would be built and open to the public in time for 
        the Olympic Games in August 2004, although recent Greek press comments 
        suggest that construction will not be finished for another two years.

      <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> 9.9.1. The idea that 
        the British Museum could open an annex for the Parthenon Sculptures in 
        Athens was first proposed to the Museum in November 2002 by the Greek 
        Culture Minister, Mr Evangelos Venizelos, although the idea had been released 
        to the press as early as July 1999. In the House of Commons on 29th October 
        2003 Estelle Morris, Minister for the Arts, confirmed on legal advice 
        that it would not be possible for the British Museum to locate repositories 
        for artefacts outside the UK without primary legislation and that the 
        Government had no plans to introduce such legislation. Furthermore, Mr 
        Venizelos confirmed in a letter in the Sunday Times on 17 August 2004 
        that the Greek Government does not recognise that the Parthenon Sculptures 
        in the British Museum are the property of the Trustees.</font></p>
      <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> 9.10. &quot;We only 
        ask for the Parthenon Sculptures - they are a special case because they 
        were made as integral pieces for a biulding that still survives and are 
        not movable works of art that can be displayed anywhere&quot;</font></p>
      <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> 9.10.1 In the past 
        the Greek Government has sought the return of other artefacts than the 
        Parthenon Sculptures. In 1965, for example, the Greek Minister of Culture 
        demanded the return of all Greek antiquities. There have also been calls 
        from individual Greek politicians for the return of the Bassai Sculptures 
        in the British Museum, the Nike of Samothrace and the Venus de Milo, both 
        in the Louvre, and the Aigina Sculptures in Munich. The Greek Government 
        insists that the Parthenon Sculptures are the only objects that it now 
        seeks to have returned, although local politicians continue to demand 
        the return of objects they think they should have returned - a recent 
        example being the call from the Mayor of Olympia for the return of a coin</font></p>
      <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">9.10.2 The claim that 
        the Sculptures are a unique case because they were made for a specific 
        building which still survives ignores many other examples of coherent 
        works of art made up of different pieces and created for specific locations 
        which are now divided between museums and galleries all over Europe. These 
        include not only other antiquities, but also the many medieval or renaissance 
        altarpieces made for churches which still survive and, unlike the Parthenon, 
        are used for their original purpose.</font></p>
      <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> 9.11. &quot;The best 
        solution is to have all the sculptures back together as a coherent whole&quot;</font></p>
      <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> 9.11.1. 9.11.1 The 
        new Acropolis Museum is designed to bring together the remaining sculptures 
        from the Parthenon within sight of the building up on the Acropolis. However, 
        only about 50% of the original sculptural decoration of the Parthenon 
        survives from antiquity. It is, therefore, no longer possible to recreate 
        the building's ornamentation as a whole which has been irretrievably damaged 
        since the seventeenth century.</font></p>
      <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">9.11.2 The removal 
        of the Parthenon Sculptures to Athens would serve to highlight above all 
        their local and national meanings. While the sculptures are understandably 
        of great importance to the national heritage and culture of Greece, through 
        the display of a significant portion of them in the uniquely diverse cultural 
        setting furnished by the British Museum for the past two centuries, they 
        and the building from which they came have also become part of a European 
        and world story of human cultural achievement. Through the current location 
        of large numbers of sculptures in both the British Museum and in Athens, 
        those different understandings of the same objects can co-exist and complement 
        one another, thus enriching our experience of what the Parthenon represents.</font></p>
      <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">9.12 &quot;The marble 
        sculptures of the Parthenon need to be seen in the bright light of Athens, 
        not in gloomy London</font></p>
      <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The idea that ancient 
        Greek sculpture was gleaming white marble is a myth. In the ancient world 
        the sculptural decoration of the Parthenon was painted in bright colours, 
        although all traces of it have long since disappeared. The figures in 
        the pediments at either end, and the metope panels on the exterior of 
        the building would have been exposed to sunlight. But the famous Parthenon 
        frieze that ran around the inner structure of the building was always 
        in the shade.</font></p>
      <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> 10. A Summary of 
        the General Debate</font></p>
      <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> 10.1. The arguments 
        used to further the return of the Parthenon sculptures in the British 
        Museum centre on three main themes. The first seeks to discredit Lord 
        Elgin and his actions, the second promotes the Parthenon sculptures as 
        a symbol of Greek identity, the third labels them imperialist spoils.</font></p>
      <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> 10.2. In reply to 
        the attacks on Lord Elgin, it cannot be stressed too much that without 
        Lord Elgin's intervention the sculptures of the Parthenon would be in 
        a very sorry state and that the modern removal of the west pediment figures 
        and the west frieze demonstrate this absolutely. <br>
        Lord Elgin can only be judged by the standards of his own day and, despite 
        attempts to bring Lord Byron's abuse to bear (Byron, in fact, believed 
        that the Parthenon should slowly melt into the landscape; he had no concept 
        of preservation and himself brought Greek sculpture back to <br>
        Britain for sale), his actions withstood the close scrutiny of a Parliamentary 
        Select Committee in 1816.</font></p>
      <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> 10.3. The second 
        position is much more emotive. Although some have attempted to counter 
        this with arguments about the purely Athenian rather than Greek nature 
        of the monument, while others have sought to query the racial mix of modern 
        Greeks, the right of the modern capital of the modern state of Greece 
        to claim its most spectacular ancient building as a symbol <br>
        of national identity cannot be gainsaid. However, the sculptures, and 
        by extension the building itself, have over the last 200 years acquired 
        a European and worldwide significance as well. This is now an essential 
        element in their appreciation which is best ensured by the continued sharing 
        of Parthenon sculptures between museums in several different European 
        countries.</font></p>
      <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">.<br>
        10.4. What should be stressed is that the acquisition of the Parthenon 
        sculptures in 1816 helped to promote the surge of philhellenism in Britain 
        that led to the involvement of the European powers in the freeing of Greece 
        and the ultimate creation in 1833 of the modern Greek state. The sculptures 
        from the Parthenon now in the British Museum have been in London longer 
        than the modern state of Greece has been in existence. As a result, they 
        have become part of this country's heritage and have acted as a central 
        focus for Western European culture and civilization, and for its admiration 
        for Greek culture. They have found their home in a museum that grew out 
        of the interest developed by the eighteenth century in culture transcending 
        national boundaries.</font></p>
      <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> 10.5. The third position 
        is the most overtly political and seems to spring from a narrow, nationalistic 
        concept of culture. It is clear that modern Greece could have no better 
        ambassador abroad than the Parthenon Sculptures in the British Museum, 
        well displayed in a free Museum and viewed by more than 4.6 million people 
        every year.</font></p>
      <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> 10.6. Ultimately, 
        however, the argument revolves not around the question of the 'Elgin Marbles' 
        but around the much larger issue of whether collections like that of the 
        British Museum are seen to have a valid role to play in world culture. 
        It calls into question the whole notion of a <br>
        single Museum in which visitors can learn about all the cultures of the 
        world, ancient and modern, and through this, learn about themselves.<br>
