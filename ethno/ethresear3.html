            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In recent years 
              the Department of Ethnography has looked to collect more systematically 
              from the American Southwest. Arizona is the home to the Navajo Reservation 
              - the largest single reservation - and few other regions today have 
              as high a concentration of Native Americans or are as culturally 
              diverse. For much of the 20th century, native arts and crafts - 
              weaving, pottery, carving and silverwork - have played a vital role 
              in sustaining these communities. However, the range and development 
              of these arts has hitherto been poorly represented in the Department 
              of Ethnography's collection.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In 1997, Henrietta 
              Lidchi embarked on building a broad and inclusive collection of 
              jewellery from the Southwest. Southwestern jewellery is typified 
              by the use of silver and turquoise but in this ostensibly simple 
              union of stone and metal, one has the melding of two sets of traditions, 
              a Puebloan lapidary tradition stretching back thousands of years, 
              and the Navajo silversmithing tradition, conservatively dated as 
              150 years old, that has spread throughout the region. Since 1997, 
              the Department of Ethnography's collection has increased to several 
              hundred pieces, and this includes a range of significant pieces 
              by known jewellers such as Victor Coochwytewa (Hopi), Christina 
              Eustace (Zuni/Cochiti), Cippy Crazy Horse (Cochiti), Yazzie Johnson 
              (Navajo) and Gail Bird (Santo Domingo), Smokey Gcachu (Zuni), <a href=compass/ixbin/goto?id=OBJ4923 target="_blank">Bob
              Haozous</a> (Apache/Navajo), Michael Kabotie (Hopi), Monica Sioux 
              King (Navajo/Pima/ Tohono O'odham), <a href=compass/ixbin/goto?id=OBJ4924 target="_blank">Clarence
              Lee</a> (Navajo), McKee Platero (Navajo), Dylan Poblano (Zuni), 
              Angie P. Reano (Santo Domingo), Joe Reano (Santo Domingo) and Perry 
              Shorty (Navajo) to mention a few.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Part of the 
              purpose of collecting is to gather as much information about the 
              methods of production, the materials and the thought processes of 
              the many artists featured, and the collection is developed in parallel 
              with notes, photographs, drawings and observations. </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Jewellery has 
              sacred and secular associations. Turquoise, in particular, is important 
              to many Native peoples of this area. Silver jewellery, in contrast, 
              became popular and possible at a point when the monetary economy 
              fully penetrated the Southwest at the end of the 19th century, and 
              from this time on until the 1950s, silver jewellery, particularly 
              for the Navajo people, has had a vital economic role, which was 
              largely based on credit. </font></p>

      </table>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Throughout its development 
        from pre-contact times, Southwestern jewellery has been shaped by contact 
        between native communities and/or with outsiders, such as traders, dealers, 
        collectors, museums, and in accordance with the availability of tools 
        and with the changing nature of demand. Jewellery is certainly one of 
        the most widespread, dynamic and popular art forms in the Southwest, and 
        the collection seeks to record this fact, from the point of view of the 
        present, although making reference to older forms. Widely produced and 
        avidly consumed by native and non-native alike, jewellery provides the 
        means through which one can explore the numerous histories and cultures 
        of the Southwest, their continuities and contemporary realities.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The collection also 
        includes tools and materials, namely a tool box with stamps, torches, 
        files and unfinished jewellery items, materials such as natural or synthetic 
        stone, jewellery made in Southwestern style from South-east Asia, and 
        pieces made in bench shops which were, and are, orientated more towards 
        the souvenir hunter rather than the collector. The collection also includes 
        several pieces made by unknown and unnamed artists in the early part of 
        the 20th century. Part of the purpose of collecting is to gather as much 
        information about the methods of production, the materials and the thought 
        processes of the many artists featured, and the collection is developed 
        in parallel with notes, photographs, drawings and observations.</font></p>
