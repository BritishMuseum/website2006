      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Over the past few 
        years, Clara Bezanilla, under the supervision of Colin McEwan and with 
        contributions from the distinguished Maya scholar Ian Graham and the foremost 
        Maya epigrapher in the UK, Simon Martin, has been collating and documenting 
        all the objects, cast, photographs and archival material in the Department 
        of Ethnography's <b><font color="#000066">Maudslay Collection</font></b><font color="#000066">. 
        <font color="#000000">The ambitious aim of this work is to enable the 
        Museum to carry out a</font> <b>Maya Writing Project</b>.</font> The components 
        that have been envisaged to make up such a project are: workshops, an 
        online COMPASS Tour, publications, a conference, an exhibition and better 
        management of and access to the collections. It remains to be seen how 
        much of this will be possible but plans are underway to hold a Maya workshop 
        and conference at the Museum, hopefully next year.</font></p>

        was Maudslay and why was he so significant?</font></b></font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Alfred P. Maudslay 
        (1850-1931) has often been referred to as the father of scientific field 
        archaeology in Mesoamerica. Inspired by the travel accounts of Stephens 
        and Catherwood, he carried out eight expeditions to the Maya area (primarily 
        to the sites of Cop&aacute;n, Quirigu&aacute;, Yaxchil&aacute;n, Chich&eacute;n 
        Itza and Palenque) between 1881 and 1894. He took superb photographs of 
        the monuments and their<font color="#000066"><b> hieroglyphic inscriptions,</b></font> 
        many of them on 12x10" glass plates. He recorded three-dimensional monuments 
        using hundreds of <b><font color="#000066">plaster moulds</font></b> which 
        were later re-assembled to produce the cast. The hieroglyphic text and 
        images found on flat surfaces were reproduced with <b><font color="#000066">paper 
        squeezes</font></b>. The plaster and paper moulds made during his expeditions, 
        at great cost, were sent to England. Maudslay donated his collection to 
        the Victoria and Albert Museum on condition that casts would be made by 
        his assistant Giuntini at the Museum's expense.</font></p>
      <p></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The magnificent work 
        that resulted from these expeditions, including drawings by Anne Hunter, 
        photographs, site plans and descriptions, were published between 1889 
        and 1902 in the 'Archeology' volumes of the <i>Biologia Centrali-Americana</i>. 
        These publications formed the first significant corpus of Maya inscriptions 
        and remain an invaluable tool to modern <b><font color="#000066">epigraphers</font></b> 
        and archaeologists.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Maudslay Collection, 
        now in the Department of Ethnography, consists of over 400 plaster casts, 
        paper and plaster moulds, glass negatives and journals written during 
        his expeditions. It also includes nine stone sculptures from Cop&aacute;n 
        (Honduras) and eight lintels from Yaxchil&aacute;n (now Mexico). The casts 
        were made between 1886 and 1891 and were later transferred to the British 
        Museum. In 1923 T.A Joyce, Deputy-Keeper of the then Department of Ceramics 
        and Ethnography, exhibited the casts and some of the original sculptures.</font></p>
