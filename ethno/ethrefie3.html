      <p> 
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">With assistance from 
        the Townley Group, work has recently begun on an exciting project to study 
        an important collection of Nasca pottery from the Pacific coast of southern 
        Peru. Nasca culture (200 BC - AD 600) is best known for the famous so-called 
        Nasca Lines - gigantic ground drawings in the desert landscape that are 
        visible from the air. The new study aims to link these drawings to the 
        rich corpus of colourful polychrome motifs painted on Nasca vessels.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Among the significant 
        South American holdings that have never been exhibited in the British 
        Museum is an extraordinary assemblage of more than three hundred Nasca 
        vessels from the Pacific coast of southern Peru. They bear bold, brilliantly 
        colourful polychrome designs which represent a veritable painted codex 
        on pottery and have the potential to unlock a world hidden from our gaze 
        for nearly two thousand years. The designs feature a range of powerful 
        deities and mythological beings, whose face masks and elaborate ritual 
        attire find their counterparts in stunning objects wrought in gold and 
        skilfully woven cotton textiles as fine as anything produced elsewhere 
        in the world at the time.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The striking contrasts 
        of the desert landscape around the Nasca Valley impress all who venture 
        there. The great snow-capped peaks of the Andean cordillera stand as a 
        spectacular backdrop and provide life-giving water to the dry coastal 
        valleys. Water-management was of vital importance to Nasca farmers, who 
        mastered the formidable challenges posed by this demanding environment. 
        Ancient graves have yielded a wealth of objects which reflect not only 
        a successful economy, but also bear witness to a rich spiritual and intellectual 
        life. Nearby, huge figurative ground drawings, or geoglyphs, are found 
        etched on the desert floor, accompanied by elaborate patterns of ceremonial 
        straight lines extending for many kilometres - the famous Nasca Lines. 
        These incorporate clearly recognisable images of plants, animals, birds 
        and fishes, which are all important elements in Nasca cosmology.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Archaeologists are 
        now beginning to unravel some of the mysteries surrounding these drawings 
        and the people that produced them. Nasca was a regional state, contemporaneous 
        with the renowned Moche culture on the north coast of Peru. It formed 
        the early climax of south-coast cultural traditions, setting the stage 
        for the later Huari and Inca empires in the adjacent Andean highlands. 
        The economy depended on a combination of agriculture, fishing and trade. 
        The capital, Cahuachi, was a noted pilgrimage site and ceremonial centre, 
        comprising extensive complexes of adobe pyramids. Here, seasonal agricultural 
        rituals were enacted, and burial finds with trophy heads testify to the 
        role played by a ‘trophy-head' cult in the annual round of fertility rites. 
        Invocations to the ancestors sought their favourable intervention to assure 
        the protection of crops and a successful harvest.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Many of the clues 
        which form the basis for reconstructing the full range and complexity 
        of the Nasca pantheon are to be found in the figures painted on the Nasca 
        vessels. The Museum's Nasca collection is one of the largest held anywhere 
        outside Peru and the first step towards the serious study of this material 
        entails making precise roll-out drawings of whole figures which are wrapped 
        around the entire circumference of many of the vessels. This task has 
        long been hindered by the lack of a graphics officer in the Department 
        of Ethnography. Fortunately, the British Museum Society's Townley Group 
        has stepped in with a generous offer of support which will enable us to 
        engage a graphic artist from outside the Museum.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The creation of the 
        roll-out drawings is a complex procedure. First, detailed sets of photographs 
        must be made of the imagery covering the whole surface of vessels which 
        often assume quite unusual shapes. Careful tracings are then made from 
        a composite ‘photo-mosaic' and the design is meticulously coloured to 
        match the original. This enables the whole figure to be observed and studied 
        while avoiding any distortion - an essential prerequisite for more detailed 
        comparative analysis. Although this methodology has not been rigorously 
        applied before to Nasca iconography, it is already apparent that the colour 
        coding is likely to contain vital information that will contribute to 
        our understanding of the hidden meanings embedded in the dense imagery.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The goal of the Nasca 
        project is to compile a comprehensive inventory of Nasca iconography by 
        category: deities, priests, animals, birds, plants, geometric motifs, 
        etc. Each category will be progressively refined as the project develops. 
        To begin with, we will focus on the most complex scenes and figures with 
        multiple elements. Motifs drawn from nature together with more abstract 
        symbols will help amplify the iconographic context. Since no complete 
        study of the full range of variation of motifs and figures has ever before 
        been undertaken, this study will reveal the entire canon of the iconography 
        and tell us much about the grammar governing the structure of the different 
        designs. The subtle variations and patterning of key elements point to 
        underlying connections between various scenes and personages which are 
        not at all obvious at first glance. Far from being random figures with 
        arbitrary associations, there are clear hints of an underlying coherence 
        to the way in which Nasca priests and artisans perceived and depicted 
        their world. Ultimately, we expect that the full corpus of mythological 
        figures and deities will offer many novel insights into the Nasca pantheon.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Future articles in 
        the BM Magazine and updates on this website will report on progress, as 
        we reconstruct the colourful cast of characters painted on the Nasca pots.</font></p>
