                          the 18th century, the collections in the British Museum 
                          were divided into &#8216;Natural and Artificial Rarities&#8217; 
                          &#8211; objects found in nature or made by people. Only 
                          a few rooms had man-made objects but case after case 
                          was filled with natural specimens. They included Sloane&#8217;s 
                          herbarium &#8211; albums of plants from around the world, 
                          all catalogued with a string of Latin names by his friend, 
                          the botanist John Ray. </font></p>

                          1735, the Swedish botanist Carl Linnaeus revolutionised 
                          the way plants, animals and other objects from the natural 
                          world were named and classified by devising a much simpler 
                          binomial (two-name) system. His pupil, Daniel Solander, 
                          was a curator in the Museum and applied the system to 
                          Sloane&#8217;s birds, animals, shells, minerals and 
                          fossils. In 1768, he travelled with the wealthy young 
                          gentleman Joseph Banks on Captain James Cook&#8217;s 
                          first voyage to the Pacific and helped to catalogue 
                          the exotic collections they gathered there. </font></p>

                          the first dinosaurs ever found &#8211; an Ichthyosaur, 
                          discovered by Mary Anning at Lyme Regis in 1821. By 
                          1880 there were so many natural history specimens that 
                          they needed a museum of their own &#8211; the Natural 
                          History Museum in South Kensington. </font> </p></td>

                        1828 antiquaries were a dying breed, replaced by specialist 
                        historians and archaeologists. But for the previous two 
                        hundred years they had collected books, manuscripts, drawings 
                        and artefacts from the past, and travelled the country 
                        studying ruins in order to learn more about Britain&#8217;s 
                        early history. It was fairly easy to learn about medieval 
                        times because more objects from those times had survived, 
                        including religious artefacts, armour, books and buildings. 
                        Antiquaries also began to survey and map Roman and earlier 
                        sites, such as Stonehenge, in a more scientific and systematic 
                        way and to learn more about the earliest Britons. This 
                        knowledge, combined with the new study of rock strata, 
                        led archaeologists to question the accepted date of the

                    to the British Museum. They joined the collections of prints 
                    and drawings, gems, coins, bronzes, vases and other classical 
                    antiquities that had come to the Museum from fellow connoisseurs 
                    such as Sir William Hamilton and Richard Payne Knight. These 
                    men studied each other&#8217;s collections to learn about 
                    the &#8216;progress&#8217; of art, from what they saw as its 
                    &#8216;primitive&#8217; beginnings in early civilisations

                    &#8211; the sculpture and architecture of classical Greece. 
                    This became the standard against which to measure all art 
                    and led, in 18th-century Britain, to a classical revival in 
                    architecture and the decorative arts. Its influence can be 
                    seen here in Wedgwood&#8217;s pottery and in the Greek Revival

                  The vast world of knowledge being gathered in the 18th century 
                  had to be classified and organized so that it could more easily 
                  understood and used. King George III&#8217;s library of nearly 
                  70,000 books (which this room was designed to house) was encyclopaedic 
                  in its scope and arranged by subject. The King loved medals 
                  and, as part of his library, these came to the Museum with his 
                  coin collection, all arranged by country and ruler to help bring 
                  past history alive. He was also keenly interested in the navy, 
                  navigation and scientific discoveries and collected instruments 
                  and working models. In the early part of the century, Sir Hans 
                  Sloane had collected unusual or beautifully made instruments. 
                  His cabinets were filled with objects that aroused curiosity 
                  and they were catalogued and displayed in many different ways 
                  - by type, material, date or purpose. The ambassador to Naples, 
                  Sir William Hamilton, catalogued his vases so that they might 
                  tell the history of Greek art. The beautiful illustrations to 
                  his book inspired a wide variety of the decorative arts in Britain.

                    The search for knowledge about the past led to renewed interest 
                    in deciphering the mysterious forms of Egyptian hieroglyphs, 
                    the curious cuneiform inscriptions found in the lands described 
                    in the Bible, and early forms of Sanskrit in India. This increased 
                    scholarly activity eventually led to &#8216;cracking their 
                    codes&#8217; in the 19th century and thousands of years of 
                    history were opened up to research. At the same time, translations 
                    were made of important books written in languages from distant 
                    lands, while nearer to home antiquaries deciphered runes and 
                    other early forms of writing, revealing more of our own history.</font>

              <em>Case 19: Gods Case 20: Magic, Mystery and Rites </em> </p>
            <p>Christian mistrust of superstition and idols, rituals and magic 
              had led to ignorance about other religions around the world. Scholars 
              in the Enlightenment attempted to dispel this ignorance by studying 
              the ancient and modern religions they encountered. They researched 
              rituals and cults in different cultures, collected religious artefacts, 
              grouped gods into families and examined their attributes and functions, 
              always searching for similarities that might shed light on the origins 
              of the world&#8217;s religions.<br>

            <p>Sir Hans Sloane&#8217;s collection included ceremonial and every 
              day objects representing customs and cultures of people around the 
              globe. They formed the beginnings of an ethnographic collection 
              that grew through the century as men like Captain James Cook and 
              Sir Joseph Banks returned from voyages of trade and discovery to 
              Australia, New Zealand, Tahiti and other Pacific islands. </p>
            <p>Others were sent by the Admiralty to discover the Northwest Passage 
              through the Arctic or by the government to forge or mend diplomatic 
              relations. Meanwhile officials of the East India and other great 
              trading companies studied the cultures of the people with whom they 
              lived, collected further artefacts and published illustrated accounts 
              that provided information about the lives and cultures of people 
              around the world.</p>
