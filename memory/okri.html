              Civilisation</b></font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> We are now 
              at the epicentre of a shift in the history of the world. The war 
              against Iraq has unleashed unsuspected forces. The first signs are 
              twofold. The need of the Americans to protect oil fields, but not 
              hospitals, museums and libraries. This is a catastrophic failure 
              of imagination and a signal absence of a sense of the true values 
              of civilisation. It does not bode well for the future. The second 
              sign is in the Iraqi people. We ask why have they turned on themselves, 
              looted their own museums, and burnt their priceless National Library. 
              The answer is simple. They have been dehumanised. They have been 
              broken by sanctions, crushed by tyranny, and annihilated by the 
              doctrine of overwhelming force. The Aztecs never recovered when 
              Henan Cortes and the conquistadores broke the faith of that ancient 
              civilisation. Persia never recovered after its destruction by Alexander 
              the Great.</font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> The war against 
              Iraq was won in the wrong way. There is a way to win that does not 
              destroy<br>
              the ancient mythic pathways of a people. And there is a way to win 
              that destroys the meaning and value of their past. The worst way 
              to win is when a defeated people turn on their ancient gods, and 
              tear them down, when a people turn on their past and burn it. And 
              they don't know why and yet they do. If the past has power and value 
              why has it brought us to this, is what <br>
              their actions say. The past has made us powerless. We need a new 
              kind of power, so that <br>
              we too can stand proud and with dignity under the sun. In this war 
              alliance failed them.</font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> It turns out 
              that we didn't believe truly the values of civilisation either, 
              or else we would have found a wiser way to win. A way in which we 
              were all winners. Now, with the looting of the museums, and the 
              burning of the National Library, with its inestimable manuscripts 
              and books, the whole of humanity is the loser. We have lost great 
              swathes of our past.</font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> This is why 
              more than ever the value of existing museums is raised to the highest 
              pitch. The importance of the work being done here at the British 
              Museum is more urgent and luminous than ever. We may well be on 
              the verge of a new dark age, when even the so-called highly civilised 
              nations no longer know what the most enduring things are. And stand 
              by and watch as darkness creeps upon us, unsuspected.</font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> The real war 
              always has been to keep alive the light of civilisation everywhere. 
              It is to keep culture and art at the forefront of our national and 
              international endeavours. </font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The end of the 
              world begins not with the barbarians at the gate, but with the barbarians 
              at the highest level of the state. All the states in the world. 
              We need a new kind of sustained and passionate and enlightened action 
              in the world of arts and spirit. </font></p>
