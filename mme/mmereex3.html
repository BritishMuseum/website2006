      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Rescue excavations 
        at Deir 'Ain 'Abata, Jordan, were begun in 1988 with the support of the 
        Department of Medieval and Modern Europe. The project, which continued 
        until 1996, resulted in the discovery of a monastic complex dating to 
        the Early Byzantine period, c.5th-7th centuries AD.</font>
      <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">A triple-apsed basilica 
      church was uncovered which was built over a natural cave. Early Christians 
      believed that this was where Lot and his daughters took refuge after the 
      destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah (Genesis 19). The church was adorned with 
      four mosaic pavements, three of which were inscribed in Greek and two of 
      which were dated April 605 and May 691 respectively. Three other inscriptions 
      on stone blocks invoked St Lot, confirming the identification of the site. 
      The church was flanked by a large, 8-metre deep reservoir to the south, 
      and a refectory and hostelry to the north. Early and Middle Bronze Age tombs, 
      and Hellenistic/Roman finds which were uncovered may allude to a pre-Christian 
      veneration of the site. </font> 
      <p></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Post excavation work 
        which began in 1993 with support of the Department of Medieval and Modern 
        Europe is now complete and will be published by the British Museum Press 
        in 2001. A selection of the site archive is held at the British Museum 
        - for further information please contact the <a href="study.html">Departmental 
        Study Room</a>.</font></p>
      <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In 1995 the site was 
      proclaimed an official holy site by His Majesty the Late King Hussein. Since 
      then the Ministry of Tourism and Antiquities of Jordan has conducted conservation 
      of the ancient structures and tourism development which includes an on-site 
      museum. The British Foreign and Commonwealth Office donated &pound;20,000 
      towards the preservation of the site. </font>
