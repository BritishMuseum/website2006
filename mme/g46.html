              The theme of trade and discovery, a defining feature of the the 
              post-medieval transition, is illustrated almost entirely by artefacts 
              which were once traded commodities, from Rhenish stoneware ceramics 
              and English cloth seals to Dutch tobacco boxes and Chinese export 
              porcelain. Porcelain from shipwrecks in the South China Sea or gold 
              and silver ingots from Spanish galleons sunk in the Caribbean form 
              spectacular evidence for the boom in international trade following 
              colonisation in the 17th and 18th centuries.&nbsp;</font> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><br>
              <br>
              The success of the cross-Channel trade in maiolica and stoneware 
              from the 16th century and the long-distance supply of Chinese porcelain 
              a century later stimulated several attempts at native production 
              during the 17th century. Excavations on the site of John Dwight's 
              Fulham Pottery, founded in 1672,&nbsp; produced evidence not only 
              for the earliest evidence for stoneware manufacture in Britain and 
              but also pioneering experiments in the manufacture of Oriental-style 
              porcelain some four decades in advance of commercial&nbsp; production 
              in Germany. </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Selections from 
              the Department’s rich collections of 18th century artefacts illuminate 
              key events and demonstrate the wealth of Europe, many parts of which 
              were subject to absolute rule.&nbsp; The British monarchy was under 
              threat from the House of Stuart, especially in 1715 and 1745. The 
              role of Parliament was evolving, particularly through the events 
              associated with John Wilkes MP who fought for free speech;&nbsp; 
              elections were riotous affairs.&nbsp; Public interest and involvement 
              is evident from the survival of engraved glasses, painted and printed 
              ceramics, ivories, enamels and tokens and medals. England, France 
              and Spain were continually extending their Empire, coming into conflict 
              in both Europe and the New World. The American War of Independence 
              in 1776&nbsp; and the French Revolution in 1789 left both profoundly 
              changed.&nbsp; Battles, executions and even philosophical movements 
              and scientific discoveries have left their trace in objects displayed 
              in the gallery. </font>

            The British Museum has recently taken on loan a fascinating group 
            of Tudor jewellery associated with the life and legacy of Sir Thomas 
            More (1477/8-1535), one of the outstanding figures of the Tudor age. 
            The group comprises two seal-dies, a cameo with a bust of the Virgin 
            Mary, and two pendants. Only one item&nbsp; can be directly associated 
            with More himself: a silver seal die with his arms and crest of a 
            Moor’s head, which he had made to commemorate his office in Henry 
            VIII’s Household as Sub-Treasurer of England between 1521-24. Another 
            jewel made during his lifetime, which may have been his, is a gold 
            reliquary in the form of a cross with delicate enamelled decoration 
            and pendant pearls.&nbsp; A second reliquary pendant appears to have 
            been made to commemorate More, probably&nbsp; in the mid 1550s.</font>
