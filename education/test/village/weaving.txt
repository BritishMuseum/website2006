&weavIntro=<font face="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif" size="14">This timber building has only one room. It is mainly used for weaving, but some of the family sleep here.</font>

&weav1=<font face="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif" size="14">This is a loom, which is used to weave cloth. This type is called a 'warp-weighted' loom. The 'warp' is the name for the vertical threads or yarns. Another yarn, the 'weft', is interwoven through the warp to create the cloth.</font>

&weav2=<font face="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif" size="14">A piece of cloth is being woven on the loom.  It is made from woollen thread. There are different ways of weaving which produce different types of cloth.</font>

&weav3=<font face="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif" size="14">This woman is weaving cloth for her family. Her daughter helps her work so that she can learn all about weaving; there is no school for children to go to in the 6th century.</font>

&weav4=<font face="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif" size="14">Before cloth can be woven, the wool is washed and carded and then spun into thread. This woman is using a spindle to spin the wool.</font>

&weav5=<font face="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif" size="14">This woman is using a 'thread-picker' to separate the warp threads, so that she can push the weft thread through more easily. The thread-picker is made from bone from one of the village pigs. </font>

&weav6=<font face="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif" size="14">The raw wool is stored here, ready to be spun and then woven into cloth.</font>

&weav7=<font face="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif" size="14">This family doesn't just weave woollen cloth. These boxes contain linen, which is made from the stems of the flax plant. Linen cloth is also woven on the loom.</font>
