The Etruscans are often portrayed as an enigmatic people of whom we know little. On the contrary we now know a vast amount about this fascinating and influential civilisation. In ancient times they were famous for their love of music, religious devotion and precious metalwork. They also had a great love of feasting, dance and sport which feature on their exuberant tomb paintings, a highlight of any visit to Tuscany.
