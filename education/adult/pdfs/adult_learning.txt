How do we look at and understand artwork from different parts 
of the world? Are Western approaches useful for appreciating other 
cultural traditions? Using case studies we consider how questions of 
collecting, display, colonialism, tourism, national identity and gender 
affect the way we study, value, exhibit and sell art objects. 
Indian struggle for independence coincided with the invention of 
cinema.This course examines early twentieth century Indian cinema, 
Bollywood movies, nationalist Bengal School film and the history of 
Indian art to explore the diverse constructions of national identity in 
Indian cinema.

An exploration of key forms of Buddhist art and artefacts in their 
religious contexts and throughout their cultural and geographical 
diversity. Using the collections of the British Museum and other 
museums we will explore the development of the image of the 
Buddha and discuss Buddhist ritual arts and more in their historical 
and contemporary settings. 
This course covers both a general introduction to the major artefacts 
and monuments of the Islamic world from AD 600, and a specific 
study of themes and issues that historically contextualise this 
material. Simultaneously it considers the numerous cross-cultural 
influences and artistic exchanges to understand the eclecticism and 
regional diversity present in the art of the Islamic lands. 
Dance has a long, complex and living history in India – folk and 
festival dance, classical and theatre dance ritual and temple dance 
and ‘filmi’ or Bollywood dance. Importantly, it also embodies a 
critical negotiation by the worldwide Indian/subcontinental diaspora. 
Using visual materials and performance, this survey course will be an 
introduction to its artistic and formal elements as well as its historical, 
philosophical and socio-cultural contexts, past and present.

Using the collections of the British Museum we will explore the 
civilisations of Ancinet Palestine from the Neolithic period to the 
end of the Iron Age.With archaeology as our starting point,we will 
interrogate the biblical texts as sources for ancient history.A 12th 
session will be organised in negotiation with the students. 
Through an examination of cinema from the Arab world, including 
Egypt,Tunisia, Lebanon and Palestine, students will develop a 
knowledge and understanding of the various critical approaches and 
genres.We will discuss issues relating to gender, the body and 
performance, and study the relationship between the national and 
global in terms of politics and identity.This course includes Saturday 
half day, Dream Makers of the Nile on 15 January. 
How have sex and gender differences been implicated in broader 
economic, political and social processes throughout American 
Indian history? Using art objects, archaeological, historical and 
anthropological data, this course examines the sexual division of 
labour, indigenous and post-colonial gender roles, ideologies, ritual, 
and the existence of third genders. 
Indonesia, Malaysia,Thailand,Vietnam, the Philippines and Cambodia 
all have a long but little known history of filmmaking. Here we 
examine South East Asian cinema in relation to nationhood and 
modernity, the Chinese diaspora, colonisation and folk entertainment. 
We will also consider how genres such as ghost and melodrama 
acquire indigenous emphasis. 
The vibrant history of dance and ritual performance in the Pacific is 
reflected in the artefacts and visual records held in institutions like 
the British Museum.We will draw on these collections, video footage 
and meetings with Pacific performers in London to explore the art 
and meanings of performance.With a focus on Polynesia we will be 
covering issues of power, relationships with spirits, gender, identity 
and cultural change.

This course will trace the mutual fascination of Orient and Occident
