<h3>About the Course</h3>
<a name="1"></a>
<b>What are the course aims and objectives?</b><br>

The fundamental aim of this course is to provide students with a broad understanding of Asian art covering all major periods and most media. In addition the course will: 

<ul>
<li>Develop a sound visual method for analysing and documenting works of art</li>
<li>Develop visual skills through the direct examination of objects</li>
<li>Develop research skills using primary and secondary sources</li>
<li>Develop writing and communication skills: to formulate and structure an academic viewpoint and to use visual analysis to support and document this  argument</li>
<li>Develop in students an understanding of certain museum skills such as: 
<br><br>
<ol type="1">
<li> Knowledge of materials, construction
techniques and issues of conservation</li>
<li> Accessing archives and storage in museums</li>
<li> Exhibition strategy, including the
interpretation of material culture in
exhibitions</li>
<li> Putting material objects in their
cultural context</li></ol>
</ul>

<a name="2"><b>What advantages are there from taking the course at the British Museum?</b></a><br>
The British Museum provides a unique opportunity to study and enjoy art from all over Asia in one of the world's greatest museums, with curators and other leading experts on China, India and South East Asia, Japan and Korea and the Islamic world. 
<p>
The teaching combines object based teaching within a sound academic framework.  Aspects of conservation, exhibition organisation (including the opportunity to prepare and display a small exhibition in the museum), and an introduction to decorative techniques and materials will also be examined.  Students will learn how to research and document objects, setting them in their cultural context.  Above all they will benefit from the guidance of Museum curators and have privileged access to a world-class collection of objects.  This, combined with theoretical and practical study, makes this a unique programme, and the Museum the foremost institution in the world for studies of this kind.</p>

<br><!-- Student assessment q and a s follow-->
<h3>Student Assessment</h3>

<a name="10"><b>How are students assessed?</b></a><br>
The course grade is determined by the results of two essays of 3,000 words (30%), and a final three-hour exam (70%). The exam consists of two parts. In the first part, students are asked to identify five out of 11 objects, and write a full museum description of these objects. Within the course, an outline is provided indicating what should be included in these descriptions. The balance of the exam consists of essay questions, which are based on the content covered in essays written during the course.

<h3>Information on each Module</h3>
<a name="19"><b>I'd like to know more about the Classical and Decorative Arts of India.</b></a><br>
From 2500BC to the present day, this course explores the
monumental, fine and decorative arts of India and South
Asia. The course deals with architecture, sculpture, miniature
painting, carved jades, carpets, textiles, furniture, jewellery,
arms and armour and the rural arts.
<p>The syllabus is broadly chronological and places the art in its
religious and historical context. The course begins with an
introduction to the Vedas, Buddhism, Jainism and Hinduism
focusing on early Jain and Buddhist art and the principles of
Hindu iconography, architecture, sculpture and wall painting.</p>
It emphasises the relationship between ritual and image in the
study of Medieval Hindu sculpture and architecture. Lectures
cover Buddhist, Jain and Hindu manuscript painting. Erotic
sculpture and painting are also discussed.
<p>The course includes Tibetan and Himalayan sculpture and
painting. The latter half of the term will explore Mughal and
Rajput court art from the 16th century. It will give particular
emphasis to miniature painting and jewellery. Terracottas,
textiles and other rural arts will also be covered and there will
be lectures on contemporary Indian painting.</p>
The course will consider issues of conservation and will provide
the student with an understanding of stone and materials in
sculpture and painting.
<br><br>
<div align="right"><a href="#top"><img src="../images/top.gif" border="0" alt="link to top of page"></a></div>
<br>
<br>
<a name="20"><b>I'd like to know more about the Classical and Decorative Arts of China.</b></a><br>
The arts of China are part of a continuous artistic tradition
of some seven thousand years. The course will be broadly
structured in a chronological fashion, concentrating
particularly on the evolution of the arts in ceramics, painting
and calligraphy, metalwork, sculpture, textiles, lacquer and
jade carving, from Neolithic times down to the 20th century.
Lectures on religion, philosophy and literature will help
set the social and political histories of the differing periods
into a wider context.

<p>The decorative arts, including furniture, architecture and garden
design will also be explored as will various themes such as
archaism, imperial and local patronage and the relationship
between the use of motifs and shapes on objects of the same
period but of different media. The importance of export markets
and the adoption of foreign artistic styles will also be assessed.
The course as in the other modules will study techniques and
issues of conservation and the use of scientific research work
in helping both to conserve and validate objects.</p>
<br><br>

<br>
<br>
<a name="21"><b>I'd like to know more about the Classical and Decorative Arts of South East Asia.</b></a><br>
This module covers the arts of mainland and maritime
South East Asia from prehistoric times to the present day.
A wide range of material from ethnographic art to the
classical arts of Buddhism, Hinduism and Islam will be
discussed. Art historical, anthropological and ethnographic
interpretations will be offered side by side, and it is expected
that this inter-disciplinary approach will greatly enhance
students&rsquo; understanding of the artistic heritage of the region.
<p>The course begins with ethnographic art and covers the arts of
Oceania, the outer Indonesian Islands and New Guinea, looking
particularly at the importance of fertility, the ancestors and the
spirit world. At this early stage there is also an introduction to
the Bronze Age and to trade in South East Asia. The next topic
is Buddhism and the magnificent Buddhist and Hindu art and
architecture of Burma, Thailand, Cambodia and Java. Among
the many other subjects covered are textiles, ceramics, painting,
lacquer-ware, metalwork, calligraphy, wood-carving and
shadow puppets.</p>

<br>
<br>
<a name="22"><b>I'd like to know more about the Classical and Decorative Arts of Japan and Korea.</b></a><br>

The larger part of the course is devoted to the arts of Japan,
beginning with the Neolithic corded pottery that gives its
name to the Jomon period and then tracing artistic and
technological developments in a variety of media down to
the 20th century. Emphasis will be placed on Buddhist art,
particularly of the Asuka, Nara, Heian and Kamakura periods,
but discussion of Shintoism will also be included, media
such as painting, calligraphy, prints, ceramics, lacquer,
textiles and metalwork will be among those examined in
detail. Architecture and gardens, the items used in the tea

<a name="23"><b>I'd like to know more about the Classical and Decorative Arts of the Islamic World.</b></a><br>

From the 7th century AD to the present day this course
explores the origin and the evolution of the arts produced
in the Muslim world: architecture, arts of the book, ceramics
and metalwork, jewellery, carved stone and ivory, arms and
armour, as well as textiles and carpets. There will be a focus
on specific objects produced in geographical regions such
as Arabia, Syria, North Africa, Iran, India and Central Asia.

<p>Among the topics covered will be the use of decorative patterns -
motifs such as the arabesque and geometric ornament will be
traced through different periods and regions. The course will
explore what is particular to Islamic art and how artists in the
Muslim world borrowed from other cultures, as well as the
impact Islamic art has had on the west. The influence of the
China trade, the exchange of luxury items along the Silk route,
and the contacts with Europe and the Mongols in Central Asia
will also be explored.</p>

The course will follow a broadly chronological structure, ensuring
clarity and continuity and a coherent framework for study.
