<p>&quot;I attended the module on Chinese Decorative Arts and I believe this course excelled in several respects. It was particularly successful in meeting the expectations of a disparate group, all having different ambitions and backgrounds. The programme balanced well the historical context, the objects of study, their production techniques or creative processes and (so far aswe know, for the more ancient artifacts) the reason for their having been made. The course material was rich and was presented by an impressive (35 strong) teaching faculty, one of the largest I have encountered, and with very minor exceptions all excellent communicators and leading experts in their fields.
<br><br>
The most distinctive feature of the course, and I believe one which makes it unique globally, is the value of having expert lectures structured around objects similar to those which the students are able shortly after to view in the Museum's own galleries or in other collections nearby, or to examine in on-site handling sessions guided by first class tutors.
<br><br>
The course is clearly of the highest quality and fittingly reflects the reputation and international reputation of the Museum. I enjoyed it tremendously&quot;<br>

<p>&quot;The Japan and Korean module provides a wonderful opportunity to learn about the art history of  Korea and  Japan.  The art originated from China but developed into a unique style. The course helps you to identify the difference between art from China, Korea and Japan, both through the lectures and handling sessions.
<br><br>
For those wishing to be a scholar in Asian art, this course provides a 'bridge' to a MA course. For those who are thinking of becoming an art dealer, this course is essential. For those who are simply interested in Asian art, you can enjoy the course (without, necessarily, the stress of taking exams!)
<br><br>
I used to work in journalism and finance for more than ten years. I decided to take this course as I was always interested in Asian art and I have collected Asian antiques as well. It's worth saying that the course is aimed at  the &quot;serious&quot; student as it is very intensive and demanding, and extremely enjoyable!&quot;<br>

<p>&quot;After living in Asia for many years, in Hong Kong, Malaysia, Singapore and  Thailand, and working there as a volunteer museum guide, it was very important for me to be able to continue my interest in Asian art and history when I returned to England. I found the answer in the British Museum Diploma in Asian Art. There, surrounded by a great mix of people, some young and some like me, rather more mature, I learned about China, India and South East Asia. The latter module covers the area where  my heart is, and my deepening knowledge has only driven me on to want to learn more. The course lecturers are some of the most respected experts in their fields, and sympathetic tutors helped me back on the road to study, after an absence of 35 years. One of the very best aspects, was the opportunity to handle priceless examples of ceramics, sculpture, paintings and manuscripts, which teach you far more, than pictures in a book, or images on a screen. We also travelled to New York, and Paris to view museums, which added to the experience enormously.  It is intensive, and stimulating and hard work....all the things which make me highly recommend it to anyone who wants to learn under the very best conditions.&quot;<br>

&quot;I found the British Museum programme to offer a unique learning experience which through its flexibility allows a very diverse student group to realize often different goals. During an intensive twelve weeks one is presented with a full survey of the relevant art history focused on one area, and encouraged to explore topics of individual interest.  The resources at one's disposal are world class:  in the lecturers who are internationally recognized experts; in the objects that one views and, in some cases, handles; and in the library facilities one can access.  All this is enhanced by one's fellow students who are of all ages, nationalities and professional and academic backgrounds.  I can't imagine a more rewarding learning experience. It met and exceeded all expectations.&quot;<br>

<p>&quot; The British Museum Diploma was a personal indulgence to satisfy my curiosity about my Chinese roots and culture within the context of art history. The major benefit of the Diploma is hands on experience in handling museum, auction house and private collections. Students are taught by leading specialists and are encouraged to use the opportunity to network. In addition, students are encouraged to explore areas for further research. Having worked in the ceramic industry, my love is Chinese ceramics, but the inspiration of the lecturers has also kindled a deep interest in Buddhist art. When I started the Diploma I automatically assumed that I would pursue a career in the dealing world by combining my commercial skills with my new found knowledge of art history. However, I have discovered that dealing is just one of the many career avenues I can pursue. It is not just what you learn on the course but whom you meet. Both gave me the inspiration to look at different areas for personal and professional development.&quot;<br>

<p>&quot;I found the Islamic art module of the British Museum Diploma in Asian Art fascinating. The Islamic module follows the historical development of the Islamic regions and their ruling dynasties.  It explores the varied art forms of the Islamic lands from the rise of the Islamic faith following the death of the Prophet Muhammad in the seventh century to the modern age. Topics covered include architecture, calligraphy, miniature painting, ceramics, metalwork, carpets and textiles.  The standard of lecturing on the course is outstanding with classes being given by world renowned experts who lecture worldwide.  The highlight of the module was a three day trip to Paris to the Paris mosque and the Islamic collections at the Louvre and the Institute du Monde Arabe.  I would strongly recommend the Islamic module to students considering pursuing the Asian Art Diploma.&quot;<br>

<p>&quot;What is Islamic Art?   If, like me, you're also one of the more 'mature' students on a course,  I guarantee you'll begin a genuinely fascinating journey. As you hunt that elusive knowledge you'll be in good company, well guided, well supported.  One of your first guides will instantly challenge some stereotypes about Islam and its art. Dr al Khemir is a renowned Islamic art historian, a published author and illustrator, a motivational lecturer and an eloquent and passionate speaker.   She is also a Muslim Arab woman. But, it is her inexhaustible ability to find connections between East and West, her generous spirit and charm, her own questioning intellect that inspired us to break through whatever blocks we had and really enter the spirit of learning.
<br><br>
The 12 weeks were fascinating.  Hard work, tiring at times.  Yes, there are essays and a final exam.  But now when I'm asked the question 'What is Islamic Art?' I can truthfully answer that it is far more than I thought - more diverse, more extraordinary, more exquisite - from a simple white bowl adorned with black calligraphy, to the delicate tracery of an arabesque on a blue tile.  The 15th century Persian poet Rumi wrote 'Inside you there's an artist you don't know about ... say yes quickly, if you know, if you've known it from before the beginning of the universe'.  I would urge you to say yes to this module - it's an absolute jewel.&quot;<br>

<p>&quot;After 20 years in the high technology business, I was seeking a new direction.  The British Museum course opened up a whole new world for me.  The combination of world class instructors, the ability to handle objects from the Museum collection, and the chance to work with other students interested in the same topic provided a great learning experience. I'm now seeking ways to turn it into a new career.&quot;<br>

<p>&quot;The Classical and Decorative Arts of China module from the British Museum Diploma in Asian Art course provided a comprehensive cultural survey of Chinese art and archaeology.  Highlights included bronzes, ceramics, jade, and painting.  As an American expatriate with a retail buying and interior design background, the course provided a solid foundation in Chinese art history and expanded knowledge in specialized categories.  This interaction
with the foremost Chinese art experts in Great Britain from the museum, academic, and commercial communities and with fellow students, who included museum board members, Asian Art dealers, and collectors, inspired me to pursue a MA in Art and Archaeology, specializing in Chinese ceramics, at the School of Oriental and African Studies at University College London.&quot;<br>

<p> &quot;I found the Islamic module mentally stimulating and highly enjoyable. The course also made one aware of the common thread that runs through the art of seemingly different cultures. After each lecture there was always room for discussion and questions and the interaction between the lecturer and students was very high. It is no doubt a demanding course but the students are well supported by the tutors. The revision sessions at the end of each week were useful. What I liked most about the course was its sensitivity to students from different cultures. The output of the course was quite phenomenal. By the end of the course it was possible for a student to walk into an Islamic gallery, be it at the British Museum, Ashmolean or the Louvre, and place the artifacts into their historical context. I feel it is this more than anything else that speaks for the high standard of the course.&quot;<br>

<p>&quot;For many years I had been interesed in China, its history and arts as a result of working in Hong Kong  in the late 70s/early 80s. The three month course was a great early retirement project - which rapidly showed me both how little I knew before, and just how interesting the topic was - with the terrific range of lecturers, the agreeable other attendees and the opportunities it gave of  direct contact with many of the artifacts we learned about. It opened a window on a world that had been completely unapparent to someone who had 
previously led a very focused life as a City lawyer.&quot;<br>

<p>&quot;I found the Islamic art diploma a unique and truly enriching experience; more vivid, more vital - more joyous! - than my previous university degrees. Our small eclectic group began the module with little to no knowledge of Islamic art and culture, and over the allotted 12 weeks we learnt an astonishing amount. We were taught by a great breadth of scholars and specialists, each with a genuine love and enthusiasm for their subject, and each eager to share and communicate that passion with the students. We travelled to Paris and around the UK to view public and private Islamic art collections. We handled pieces of Islamic art, feeling their weight or delicacy, their coolness and texture; we 'connected' with objects that, without the course, we would only have glanced at in the cold, 2-dimensionality of books, or behind the glass of museum cabinets. I felt the great gift that the course gave us was a language, both visual and conceptual, that allowed us to see in carpets, calligraphy, ceramics, manuscripts that which we had previously been blind. Under the close personal supervision of our course tutors we began to appreciate the vibrant wealth of history, culture, philosophy, and art that resonate from Islamic art pieces.I found this also to be the case in the Indian and Chinese diplomas I took. I found the course was a tremendously valuable and enjoyable experience.&quot;<br>
