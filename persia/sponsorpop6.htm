      <br>
The National Petrochemical Company (NPC), a subsidiary of Iranian Petroleum Ministry, is owned by the government of the Islamic Republic of Iran and is responsible for the development and operation of the country&rsquo;s petrochemical sector. <br>
        <br>
      Founded in 1964, while operating a fertilizer plant in Shiraz near the ruins of Persopolis, today, NPC is the second largest producer and exporter of petrochemicals in the Middle East. Gradually, while expanding the range and volume of its products, it has taken steps in areas such as Research and Technology to achieve more self-sufficiency. <br>
      <br>
      Currently, NPC owns 15 production complexes and is further building 30 petrochemical projects with Iranian private sector contributing to 11 and foreign partners investing in 8 of such projects. <br>
      <br>
      Two special economic zones on the northern coast of the Persian Gulf have been developed to be home to NPC&rsquo;s new projects, enjoying a good access to feedstock, infrastructural facilities, local and international markets, skilled manpower and access to international waterways.<a href="javascript:window.close();"><br>
