      Founded in 1937 in Tehran, The National Museum of Iran was originally called Iran Bastan Museum ( Museum of Ancient Iran). The National Museum of Iran is an archaeological and historical museum. Its facade was designed in Sasanian architectural style by Andre Godard after a Sasanian period palace of Sarvestan.<br>      <br>
      Today the National Museum of Iran includes two buildings, the old building for the collection of Ancient Iran and another for the Islamic period, in addition to having a library and a lecture hall.<br>      <br>
      The collection from the Museum of Ancient Iran consists of artifacts from the Palaeolithic to pre-historic periods, Elamite civilization, the Acheamenid Persian Empire, Selucid and Parthian to the end of the Sasanian period in 7th Century AD.<br>      <br>
      The Islamic Museum begins in the 7th century and continues to the end of Qajar Dynasty (beginning of 20th century). The museum includes different departments, such as conservation, pre-historic, Ancient, Islamic. The National Museum of Iran regularly has temporary exhibitions. <br>      <br>
