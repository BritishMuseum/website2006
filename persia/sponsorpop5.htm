The Iran Heritage Foundation is a non-political UK registered charity founded in 1995, with the mission to increase awareness about, promote and preserve the history, languages and cultures of Iran. The objectives of the Foundation are pursued by means of organising and supporting research, publication, and diverse activities of cultural or scholarly merit in a variety of related fields, on a worldwide basis. The Foundation interprets its remit generously and initiates a wide range of programmes intended to provide a forum to facilitate not only the study of Iran&rsquo;s culture both among students and the wider academic community but also to <br>
present all aspects of Persian culture (ancient and modern) to the public at large.<a href="javascript:window.close();"><br>
