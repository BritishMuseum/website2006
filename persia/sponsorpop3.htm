      Bank Melli Iran was established in September 1928 by Act of Parliament as Iran&rsquo;s first commercial bank and has played a key role in Iran&rsquo;s economic development since that era. Bank Melli Iran is Iran&rsquo;s largest bank in terms of assets and would rank as the 12th largest bank in the United Kingdom on this measure.<br>      <br>
      Today Bank Melli Iran remains the country&rsquo;s leading financial institution offering a broad range of Islamic, retail and wholesale banking products to millions of customers with over 3,000 domestic branches, 16 foreign offices and in excess of 41,000 employees. 40% of all domestic deposits and 35% of all commercial bank credit in Iran are handled by Bank Melli Iran.<br>      <br>
      The Bank is an important partner to leading private and public institutions in all economic sectors and facilitates international trade and investment in Iran through its global network.<br>      <br>
      Bank Melli Iran is pleased to sponsor this Exhibition, through which the ancient and rich culture and heritage of the Islamic Republic of Iran is made more accessible to a wider audience.      <a href="javascript:window.close();"><br>
