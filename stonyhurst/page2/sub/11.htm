      This model of a tikanagan, well illustrates the basic principals of a cradle 
      type used over much of the North American Woodlands and Plains. Cradles 
      were used particularly in day time, for transporting and moving children 
      around, providing a safe and reassuring environment. 
      <p>Newborn babies would be swaddled in moss in a birchbark and wrapped in 
        a deer skin before being tied on a board; they could then be carried on 
        the back, or placed somewhere near - outside for instance when winnowing 
        wild rice, making bark trays, or picking berries. Boards kept the back 
        straight, and ensured the baby was safe, both from dogs, and from falls, 
        the foot rest and bow protecting the head and feet. </p>
      <p>Swamp or sphagnum moss was widely used. One elder told ethnologist Imez 
        Hilger in the 1930s: 'When moss was used for diapers (nappies) the baby 
        seldom became chafed, and when it was unwrapped you could smell only sweet 
        moss'. Rabbit skin was also used as nappies, ash or powdered rotten wood 
        as powder, and deer fat as cream. </p>
      <p>A full sized cradle might be 60-80 cm long, tapering in width from 30 
        cm at the top and 24 cm to the bottom, with a 40 cm high bow. One of the 
        materials used for the bow was a splint of ash wood; this same material 
        is still much used in the Woodlands for basketry, and for lining canoe 
        models. </p>
      <p>The board is here decorated with red pigment, pyrography, and with cut 
        and incised designs including hearts. Toys and amulets were traditionally 
        attached to the bent bow; the attaching cord might be quite loose so that 
        the baby could slip the toys back and forth. These might include the crania 
        of duck, duck feathers, animal teeth, navel bags, porcupine bones, and 
        what are now called Dream Catchers. The anthropologist Frances Densmore 
        was told in the 1920s that these 'catch everything evil as a spider's 
        web catches and holds everything that comes in contact with it'. </p>
      <p>Another possible ornament was a little birchbark cone filled with maple 
        sugar for sucking. Here the main toys are bunches of bells; this indicates 
        that the babies father was a proficient fur trader, exchanging pelts and 
        skins, laboriously and carefully prepared by the child's mother, for luxury 
        manufactured goods such as cloth and beads. Further to the north and west 
        moss bags without boards were used by First Nations to swaddle babies.
