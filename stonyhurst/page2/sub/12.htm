<p>Rawhide section of a parfleche, or storage envelope, painted with abstract 
        geometric designs. While this French Canadian term refers to parrying 
        (parer) an arrow (fl&ecirc;che), and so to raw hide shields, parfleches 
        are containers formed of sheets of decorated rawhide. They are folded 
        with rectangular, rather than triangular, flaps. </p>
      <p>Parfleches were used in great numbers by women of the Plains, Rocky mountain 
        and Plateau regions to store everything from pemmican, ground buffalo 
        meat with fat and berries, to household utensils. Their purpose, was, 
        of course to facilitate transportation, whether it was by dog travois 
        in the pre-horse days or, later, by horse. </p>
      <p>The preferred skin was buffalo before their virtual disappearance by 
        the 1880s. Buffalo rawhide was replaced by cattle, and also by elk and 
        horse hide. The fresh hide would de-fleshed, and then stretched and dried 
        by pegging towards, but just off the ground. Washing, scraping and thinning 
        would then take place. The best way of removing hair was by pounding with 
        a flat axe back or stone; this also made of the exterior surface of the 
        skin bright and white; an alternative was scraping off the hair with an 
        elk antler scraper. </p>
      <p>The painting was executed on the flesh side of the skin, and sized, with 
        a liquid made from skins scrapings, to protect the finish article and 
        contents from damp. The abstract geometric painting style is associated 
        with that used on Great Lakes and Woodlands robes, and in general terms 
        is without symbolic meaning. When parfleches were worn out, the rawhide 
        would be cut up and recycled to make moccasin soles; the painted sides 
        would be left on the interior.<br>
