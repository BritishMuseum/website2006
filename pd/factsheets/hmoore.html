            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3" color="#000066"><b>Henry 
              Moore (1898-1986)</b></font> </p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Born in Castleford, 
              Yorkshire, the son of a miner, Henry Moore showed promise at an 
              early age, winning a scholarship to the local grammar school. In 
              1917 he travelled to London to enlist in the 15th London Regiment 
              (Civil Service Rifles), making his first visit to the British Museum. 
              He was sent to France and was later gassed at the Battle of Cambrai. 
              In 1919 he returned to Yorkshire to attend Leeds College of Art 
              where he was the first student to study sculpture. Two years later 
              Moore won a scholarship to the Royal College of Art. In London he 
              drew extensively from sculpture in the British Museum, including 
              material from the ethnographic collections. His first visit to Paris 
              was in 1923, followed in 1925 with an extensive tour of the major 
              places in central and northern Italy. On his return he resumed teaching 
              at the RCA, and began studying bones at the Natural History Museum 
              and different types of English stone at the Geological Museum; this 
              led to his first transformation drawings of 1926, based on analogies 
              between natural forms and the human figure.</font> </p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Moore's first 
              one-man show was at the Warren Gallery in London in 1928. In 1929 
              he married Irina Radetsky, a painting student at the RCA, as well 
              as completing his reclining figure inspired by a reproduction of 
              a carving of the Mexican rain-spirit Chacmool. The thirties saw 
              Moore increasingly associated with avant-garde groups such as the 
              7 and 5 Society and Unit One, formed by Paul Nash. By the end of 
              the decade modelling and casting had begun to take precedence over 
              direct carving for his sculpture. Drawing continued to play a vital 
              role in his work, becoming of paramount importance during the early 
              years of the Second World War, when he produced some of his most 
              powerful and moving drawings, studies of Londoners sheltering from 
              the Blitz in the Underground.</font> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Moore 
              described his feelings on first seeing the figures in the Underground:<i> 
              <br>
              <br>
              I spent the time looking at the rows of people sleeping on the platforms. 
              I had never seen so many reclining figures, and even the train tunnels 
              seemed to be like the holes in my sculpture</i>. </font>

            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">He was subsequently 
              appointed as an official war artist by the War Artists' Advisory 
              Committee under the chairmanship of Sir Kenneth Clark. Moore returned 
              to sculpture with the <i>Madonna and Child,</i> commissioned for 
              St Matthew's Church, Northampton and unveiled in February 1944. 
              After the War he produced various public commissions; one of the 
              most prestigious was a sculpture for the new UNESCO headquarters 
              in Paris, installed in 1958, for which the British Museum owns preparatory 
              drawings. </font> 
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#000066"><b>Drawings</b></font>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b> </b>The 
              British Museum has thirty-five drawings by Henry Moore, the majority 
              of which were presented by the artist himself or by Lord Clark. 
              In addition, Jane, Lady Clark, bequeathed in 1977 the first of the 
              <i>Shelter Sketchbooks</i>, dating from the latter end of 1940, 
              while nine of the single-sheet drawings were acquired in 1988 from 
              the estate of Lord Clark after they had been accepted in lieu of 
              tax by the Commissioners of the Inland Revenue. The most famous 
              of these is the compositions <i>Crowd Looking at a Tied-up Object</i> 
              of 1942. </font> 
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The collection 
              in the Department of Prints and Drawings covers most of Moore's 
              career. Several drawings of monumental nudes date from the 1920s. 
              Drawings from the thirties are mostly ideas for metal or stone sculpture.</font> 
              <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">After he had 
              completed the Shelter drawings in 1941, Moore visited the Wheldale 
              Colliery in his hometown of Castleford, where he recorded the miners 
              at work. The British Museum possesses five of sheets from the coalmining 
              sketchbook. A double-page drawing by Moore of helmet heads, executed 
              in 1950, appears in the Visitors' Book for the Institute of Contemporary 
              Arts, which belongs to the Museum.</font>

            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b> </b>Among 
              the material owned by the British Museum is a set of Moore's early 
              collographs plus working proofs; his lithograph for the third series 
              of School Prints, <i>Sculptural Objects</i> of 1949, and three of 
              his illustrated portfolios: Goethe's<i> Promethée</i>, translated 
              by André Gide, 1950 (eight lithographs); <i>Elephant Skull</i>, 
              1970 (twenty-five etchings); <i>Selections from poems by Auden</i>, 
              1974 (twenty-one lithographs). The main repositories of his prints 
              belong to Tate in London and to the Henry Moore Foundation at Much 
              Hadham in Herts.</font>
