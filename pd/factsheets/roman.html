              Baroque Drawings</b></strong></font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The word 'Baroque' 
              probably derives from a Portuguese term for a misshapen pearl and 
              originally meant 'irregular or grotesque'. It has, however, come 
              to signify the dominant artistic style of the seventeenth century, 
              which originated in Rome in the 1620s and lasted until the end of 
              the century. It is closely associated with the names of Bernini 
              and Pietro da Cortona in painting and sculpture and with Borromini 
              in architecture, and has been called 'one of the most creative periods 
              of the whole history of Italian art'<br>
              </font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">.</font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#000000"><img src="images/romanb.jpg" width="286" height="217" align="left" vspace="10" hspace="10" alt="Scene from Tasso&acute;s Jerusalem Liberated : Rinaldo Fleeing with Carlo and Ubaldo from the Seductress Armida"></font><br>
              <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><br>
              The influence of the Catholic Church, which had been eroded during 
              the Protestant Reformation, was reaffirmed by a succession of powerful 
              popes, notably Urban VIII Barberini, Innocent X Pamphilj and Alexander 
              VII Chigi. The popes and their entourage triumphantly celebrated 
              the Catholic faith: new churches were built, old ones embellished, 
              and recently canonized saints such as Francis Xavier, Teresa of 
              Avila and Thomas of Villanueva glorified in paint and marble. An 
              emphasis on mystical inner experience resulted in numerous representations 
              of the martyrdom and religious ecstasy of saints.<br>

            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Baroque 
              was also a time of worldly splendour, with enormous sums expended 
              on lavish palace and theatre decorations, fountains and extensive 
              urban planning. The interior of the Barberini Palace was decorated 
              by Andrea Sacchi and Pietro da Cortona; Grimaldi designed stage 
              sets for the adjacent theatre and countless noble families, among 
              them the Pamphilj, Chigi and Sacchetti, commissioned the building 
              and embellishment of country villas. The prospect of such papal 
              and aristocratic patronage attracted artists from all over Italy 
              and Europe. The arrival in Rome of Domenichino and Lanfranco from 
              Emilia, Gaulli from Genoa, the Cortese brothers from France, and 
              Schor and Seiter from Austria helped make Rome the artistic capital 
              of the time. Artists would meet at the homes of collectors and at 
              the Accademia di San Luca, a type of painter's club, where lessons 
              in life drawing and art-theoretical debates took place. Increasingly, 
              painters began to specialise in particular genres, with Giacomo 
              Cortese gaining renown for his battle scenes, Ottavio Leoni for 
              drawn portraits, and Onofri for landscapes. </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Much of Baroque 
              painting and sculpture is characterised by drama, emotional expressiveness, 
              explicit gestures and spiralling or diagonal compositions, such 
              as one associates with the art of Bernini, Pietro da Cortona and 
              Gaulli. The epitome of this exuberant style is Cortona´s ceiling 
              fresco in the great hall of the Barberini Palace, which glorifies 
              the reign of Pope Urban VIII. There was always a more restrained 
              current, often labelled ´classical`, which harked back to the example 
              of Raphael and the High Renaissance and favoured symmetry, subdued 
              colours and fewer figures. This second trend is exemplified by the 
              work of Domenichino, Sacchi and the latter's pupil Maratti. </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The British 
              Museum owns an excellent collection of drawings by more than forty 
              different artists from this period, covering all the major as well 
              as many of the lesser-known painters. There are print and medal 
              designs by Bernini relating to his remodelling of the Square and 
              Basilica of St Peter's (e.g. <i>Plan of Colonnade</i>, 1659; <i>Medal 
              Commemorating the Cathedra Petri</i>, 1662) as well as portraits 
              and drawings of catafalques - temporary structures erected in honour 
              of the deceased (Catafalque to the Duc de Beaufort, 1669). Two further 
              sculptors, Algardi and Cafà, are also represented. A strong group 
              of drawings by Pietro da Cortona documents nearly all his major 
              commissions, including the Villa Sacchetti at Castelfusano (<i>Vulcan's 
              Forge</i>, 1628), the Palazzo Barberini (<i>Woman Carrying Fasces</i>, 
              1630s) and the Chiesa Nuova (<i>Prophets</i> for the pendentives, 
              1659-60). The painters who trained in Cortona´s studio and flourished 
              in the second half of the century are represented by such important 
              works as Romanelli´s tapestry design of <i>Dido and Aeneas</i> (late 
              1630s), Gimignani´s <i>Battles</i> (1647), and Ferri´s <i>Crucifixion</i> 
              (1662). Sacchi´s studies for <i>St Anthony raising a Man from the 
              Dead</i> (1630s) and the Mola´s cartoon of a kneeling man and two 
              further studies in the Department for the fresco<i> Joseph Greeting 
              his Brethren</i> (1650s) relate to major commissions carried out 
              by these artists. There are also several drawings by Gaulli, who 
              worked in the tradition of Bernini, and by Maratti, the leading 
              artist of the late 17th century (e.g. <i>Jael and Sisera</i> for 
              the Presentation Chapel in St Peter's, 1670s/80s). Examples of the 
              draughtsmanship of Maratti´s followers dei Pietri and Passeri signal 
              the final years of the great Baroque tradition. </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The collection 
              is particularly strong in finished compositional drawings. Numerous 
              portraits (by Leoni, Maratti), landscapes (Cortona, Grimaldi), caricatures 
              (Mola, Maratti), and designs for altarpieces, engravings (Canini, 
              Testa), sculpture (Algardi) and the decorative arts (Schor) serve 
              to illustrate the variety of the artistic production of the period. 
              A more thorough study of certain aspects is provided by three albums 
              containing, respectively, life drawings, most of which remain anonymous, 
              and studies by Grimaldi and Cortese. For sheer virtuosity Pietro 
              da Cortona's <i>Jason and the Golden Fleece</i> and his <i>River 
              Landscape</i>, Domenichino's <i>Head of St Luke</i>, Gaulli's <i>Sangue 
              di Cristo</i> (<i>Resurrected Christ on Clouds with Angels</i>) 
              and Ottavio Leoni's <i>Self-portrait</i> deserve a mention. <br>
