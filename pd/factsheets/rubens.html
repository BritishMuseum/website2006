              Rubens was born in Siegen in Germany (Westphalia) in 1577. His father, 
              a courtier, died in 1578 and the family returned to their native 
              Antwerp. There Rubens trained under three artists, Tobias Verhaecht, 
              Adam van Noort and probably also Otto van Veen. In 1598 he was registered 
              as an independent master in the Antwerp Guild, but left for Italy 
              in 1600. He remained there until 1608, receiving employment from 
              the Gonzaga family in Mantua, and working extensively in Rome and 
              Genoa. He also visited Spain in 1603. By the time he returned to 
              Antwerp, he had established his reputation as a leading painter, 
              and had studied antique and Renaissance works of art assiduously.</font></p>

            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><font color="#666666" size="1">Left: 
              Portrait of Isabella Brant, </font></font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1" color="#666666">coloured 
              chalks, 1622<br>
              381 x.295 mm, PD1893-7-31-21 (Hind 92)</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In Antwerp from 
              1609, he rapidly became the most favoured painter at the court of 
              Archduke Albert, confirming his stature as an artist with his great 
              altarpieces of the <em>Raising of the Cross</em> and the <em>Descent 
              from the Cross</em> for Antwerp Cathedral (where they still hang). 
              In 1609 he married Isabella Brant (d.1626), of whom there is a drawing 
              in the Museum's collection, and from 1612 began to design book illustrations 
              for the Plantin Press in Antwerp. His contact with the English court 
              began in 1612, when he painted the portrait of the Earl of Arundel, 
              and in 1618 Rubens acquired a collection of antique statues from 
              Sir Dudley Carleton, British Ambassador at The Hague. In the 1620s 
              he was to work for Charles I and the Duke of Buckingham.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">By 1620, commissions 
              came his way in large quantities from many parts of Europe, and 
              he employed a growing team of pupils and assistants to collaborate 
              on his paintings. Knowledge of his style was also disseminated by 
              engravings made afer his paintings by professional printmakers working 
              under his supervision. </font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In 
              1630, four years after the death of Isabella Brant, Rubens married 
              the sixteen-year-old H&eacute;l&egrave;ne Fourment. In 1635, he 
              bought a country house, the Ch&acirc;teau de Steen, near Malines, 
              where he spent much of his time during the last ten years of his 
              life, the grounds inspiring several landscape paintings.</font></p>
            <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> </font> 
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Drawing was 
              a fundamentally important activity for Rubens, both in devising 
              his own compositions and for recording the antique and Renaissance 
              masters he admired. The British Museum contains a superlative collection 
              of some eighty drawings by him, as well as forty drawings from his 
              so-called 'Costume Book', an early compilation of study material 
              from various sources, and a series of rapid sketches after antique 
              coins. They were all exhibited, together with loans from other collections, 
              at the British Museum in 1977 (see below for catalogue).</font></p>
            <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> </font> 
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Among Rubens's 
              Flemish pupils, collaborators and followers, the Museum has drawings 
              by Anthony Van Dyck (an important collection), Abraham van Diepenbeck, 
              Jacob Jordaens, Erasmus Quellinus, Cornelius Schut, Frans Snyders, 
              Theodor van Thulden, Lucas van Uden and Lucas Vorsterman.</font></p>
            <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> </font> 
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Only one print, 
              an etching of <em>St. Catherine of Alexandria</em>, is believed 
              to be by Rubens himself, although the attribution is uncertain. 
              The Museum has impressions of this print, as well as a large series 
              of the reproductive engravings made after his designs and under 
              his supervision. These are kept together with other reproductions 
              of his work and arranged according to the catalogue by C.G. Schneevogt 
              of 1873. Among the more important printmakers who worked for Rubens 
              are Paul du Pont (Paulus Pontius). Schelte &agrave; Bolswert, Pieter 
              Soutman and the woodcut specialist, Christoffel Jegher.</font></p>
