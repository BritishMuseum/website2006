              British Museum has almost ninety drawings by Michelangelo, one of 
              the towering figures of the Italian renaissance whose artistic activities 
              encompassed sculpture, painting, and architecture. Underlying his 
              achievements in all these fields was a dedication to drawing: the 
              perfection of the finished work achieved only after an exhaustive 
              preparation of every aspect of the finished composition on paper. 
              This manner of working, a constant in his seventy-year career, was 
              central to the Florentine artistic tradition that Michelangelo learnt 
              in the workshop of the painters Domenico and Davide Ghirlandaio. 
              Michelangelo in turn passed this precept down to his pupils, as 
              is shown by the exhortation directed to his pupil Antonio Mini written 
              on one of the Museum's drawings: 'Draw, Antonio, draw, and don't 
              waste time'.</font></p>

            <p class="factsheets"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The 
              Museum's collection of his drawings is unusually complete in its 
              coverage of his stylistic development, with works from every decade 
              from 1500 until the 1560s, and in having studies related to a number 
              of his most important commissions: including the unfulfilled Battle 
              of Cascina fresco (1504-7); the Sistine chapel ceiling (1508-12) 
              and Last Judgement frescoes (1536-41); and the Medici chapel in 
              San Lorenzo, Florence (1520-34). It also includes highly finished 
              presentation drawings in chalk intended as gifts for friends, such 
              as the handsome Roman nobleman Tommaso de' Cavalieri or Michelangelo's 
              confidante and fellow poet Vittoria Colonna; a portrait in black 
              chalk of the youthful Andrea Quaratesi (the only surviving portrait 
              by the artist); a design for silverware; a full-size cartoon of 
              the Holy Family (on permanent display in Gallery 90) for a painting 
              by his biographer Ascanio Condivi now in the Casa Buonarroti, Florence; 
              and two of his intensely moving Crucifixion studies made right at 
              the end of his life, probably for his own private devotion. </font></p>
            <p class="factsheets"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Born 
              into the minor bourgeoisie Buonarroti family in Caprese, near Sansepolcro, 
              Michelangelo underwent formal schooling until the age of 13 (a rarity 
              among artists of his period). In 1488 he was apprenticed as a painter 
              in the workshop of the leading Florentine painters of the day, the 
              Ghirlandaio brothers, and the following year he joined a group of 
              young sculptors training in the Medici gardens in San Marco. His 
              precocious artistic talent was first revealed in his marble reliefs, 
              the Battle of the Centaurs and the Donatello-inspired Madonna of 
              the Stairs (both Casa Buonarroti, Florence) executed in his late 
              teens, and slightly later in the Bacchus (Bargello, Florence) executed 
              in Rome in 1496. Around the same period he painted the unfinished 
              panel, the Virgin and Child with St John and Angels (known as the 
              'Manchester Madonna'), in the National Gallery, London. Michelangelo's 
              artistic reputation was firmly established by the virtuoso marble 
              Pietà (St Peter's, Rome) completed in 1500 for the tomb of a French 
              Cardinal. While in Rome he also worked on the unfinished panel of 
              the Entombment (c.1500-1) now in the National Gallery, London.</font></p>
            <p class="factsheets"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> 
              In 1501 Michelangelo returned to Florence where he remained until 
              1504, completing the gigantic marble David (Accademia, Florence), 
              the sculpture of the Madonna and Child (Bruges, Notre Dame) and 
              the circular painting of the Holy Family (the 'Doni Tondo', Uffizi, 
              Florence). Unfulfilled commissions from this period, an oft-repeated 
              pattern in Michelangelo's career, include 12 marble apostles for 
              Florence cathedral of which only the unfinished Matthew resulted 
              (Accademia, Florence); two circular marble roundels of the Virgin 
              and Child (Bargello, Florence and Royal Academy, London); and the 
              Battle of Cascina fresco for the Sala del Gran Consiglio in the 
              Palazzo Vecchio. The latter only progressed to a cartoon (a large-scale 
              drawing), now destroyed, of the central section of the composition 
              known as the Bathers for its depiction of nude Florentine soldiers 
              struggling into their armour after a swim. The twisting, contorted 
              poses of the figures (a large pen drawing for one of them is in 
              the British Museum collection) were tremendously influential and 
              are frequently cited in contemporary paintings and prints. </font></p>
            <p class="factsheets"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In 
              1505 Michelangelo was summoned to Rome by Pope Julius II who commissioned 
              him to execute his tomb in St Peter's. The unrealistic ambition 
              of Michelangelo's scheme, comprising over forty statues and numerous 
              bronze reliefs, as well as the competing claims on the artist's 
              time imposed on him by Julius and successive popes, meant that the 
              project was doomed from the outset. What Michelangelo's sixteenth-century 
              biographer Ascanio Condivi coined 'the tragedy of the tomb' finally 
              concluded with the erection in 1545 of the severely scaled-down 
              monument (whose most celebrated element is the Moses) in the Roman 
              church of S. Pietro in Vincoli. In 1508 Pope Julius also commissioned 
              Michelangelo to decorate the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel, a work 
              completed by the end of 1512. A drawing in the Museum gives an idea 
              of the initial very simple scheme consisting of Apostles in the 
              spandrels and geometric ornamentation on the vault. This evolved 
              into a far more complex arrangement of fictive stone architecture 
              and a multitude of figures, some of which are dramatically foreshortened 
              like the figure of Haman whose pose is studied in a drawing in the 
              collection. Michelangelo's luminous red chalk studies for figures 
              in the ceiling (like the Museum's celebrated Adam) are among the 
              most sensuous representations of the male nude ever created. The 
              scale and grandeur of the Sistine ceiling ushered in a new type 
              of heroic painting, and it quickly became one of the canonical works 
              of the renaissance; its fame spread by drawings and engravings made 
              after it. </font></p>
            <p class="factsheets"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Although 
              Michelangelo was not the solitary genius of popular myth, his assistants 
              played little or no part in the creative process their input being 
              largely confined to minor help in the execution of works. His great 
              rival Raphael, by contrast, attracted some of the brightest young 
              artists to work for him, and with brilliant managerial skill harnessed 
              their talents to keep abreast of the swelling tide of papal and 
              private commissions that flowed into his Roman studio. Michelangelo 
              was temperamentally unsuited to such collaborative methods of working 
              (one of the reasons that so many of his commissions were left unfulfilled), 
              but he was on occasion ready to help less gifted artist friends 
              by giving them compositional and figure studies. The earliest example 
              of this practice is the drawings he supplied to the Venetian painter 
              Sebastiano del Piombo in 1516 for two projects: the Flagellation 
              of Christ fresco in the Borgherini chapel in S. Pietro in Montorio, 
              Rome; and the Raising of Lazarus altarpiece for Narbonne cathedral 
              (now National Gallery, London). The Museum has two studies for each 
              of these projects. In the early 1530s he made a cartoon of Venus 
              and Cupid, a slight pen-and-ink sketch for which is in the collection, 
              for a painting by Pontormo, and in the 1550s he also supplied drawings 
              to Daniele da Volterra and Condivi. </font></p>
            <p class="factsheets"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The 
              death of Julius in 1513 provided fresh impetus to Michelangelo's 
              work on his tomb, and over the next three years he sculpted the 
              Moses and the two unfinished Slaves (both Louvre, Paris). The election 
              of two Florentine popes, Leo X (1513-21) and Clement VII (1523-34), 
              both members of the Medici family, resulted in Michelangelo's departure 
              from Rome and return to Florence in 1516. He was to remain there 
              for the next sixteen years working on various commissions related 
              to the Medici family church of S. Lorenzo. Michelangelo began by 
              winning the coveted commission for the façade of the church in 1516, 
              but it never progressed beyond the design stage and was abandoned 
              in 1520. Around the same period (1519-20) work began on the New 
              Sacristy of S. Lorenzo (so-called because it was built as a pendant 
              to Brunelleschi's Old Sacristy of the 1420s) built as a mausoleum 
              for the newly deceased Medici dukes Lorenzo of Urbino and Giuliano 
              of Nemours - the Capitani- , along with their fifteenth-century 
              ancestors Lorenzo the Magnificent and his brother Giuliano - the 
              Magnifici. Four drawings in the collection document the evolution 
              of Michelangelo's ideas for the tombs, the earliest of which shows 
              a four-sided free-standing monument. The interior and the Capitani 
              wall-tombs, consisting of seated idealised representations of the 
              deceased with reclining allegorical figures of the Times of Day, 
              were largely completed before Michelangelo's departure for Rome 
              in 1534. The Magnifici tomb was never built, the only surviving 
              element from it is the unfinished marble of the Madonna and Child. 
              While in Florence Michelangelo was also commissioned by Clement 
              VII in 1523 to design at S. Lorenzo a public library, the Biblioteca 
              Laurenziana, to house the library of his uncle Lorenzo the Magnificent. 
              Two drawings in the Museum are related to the library's vestibule: 
              a pen-and-ink elevation, and a study in the same medium of the doorway. 
              While in Florence he sculpted the Risen Christ (1519-20) for the 
              Roman church of S. Maria sopra Minerva, and the Victory (Palazzo 
              Vecchio, Florence) created in the first half of the 1520s probably 
              for the tomb of Julius II, but left in his Florentine studio until 
              his death.</font></p>
            <p class="factsheets"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> 
              In 1534 Michelangelo was called back to Rome by Clement VII who 
              commissioned him shortly before his death to fresco the altar wall 
              of the Sistine Chapel. Clement's successor, Paul III, endorsed the 
              idea and work commenced on the Last Judgment fresco in the autumn 
              of 1536 and it was finished by the end of 1541. The Museum has an 
              early compositional study in black chalk for the right-hand side 
              of the composition, and four figure studies in the same medium. 
              The fresco is profoundly different in spirit from the joyous physicality 
              of the Sistine Chapel ceiling, the darker and more introspective 
              nature of the Last Judgement engendered by its theme of Redemption 
              and Damnation, and also by the more pessimistic outlook of the sixty-year 
              old artist and of the Catholic Church itself, still bruised by the 
              Sack of Rome a decade or so earlier. The nudity of Michelangelo's 
              figures was criticised by contemporary critics, most famously by 
              the sometime pornographer Pietro Aretino, and in 1558 Pope Paul 
              IV ordered Daniele da Volterra to paint draperies over offending 
              parts of the fresco. The weighty, almost ponderous muscularity of 
              Michelangelo's figures in the Last Judgement became even more exaggerated 
              in his last fresco decoration in the Pauline Chapel in the Vatican 
              (1542-5). The composition and narrative of the two frescoes, the 
              Conversion of St Paul and the Crucifixion of St Peter, are highly 
              formalised, the rhetorical gestures of the protagonists and the 
              settings deliberately abstracted from reality. The deeply spiritual, 
              almost visionary quality of Michelangelo's late painting style is 
              also found in his celebrated series of Crucifixion studies (two 
              of which are in the Museum), and in the two unfinished Pietà marbles 
              sculpted in c.1547-55 (Museo del Opera del Duomo, Florence) and 
              the Rondanini Pietà of c. 1552/3-64 (Castello, Sforzesco, Milan). 
              In the last two decades of his life Michelangelo was also busy on 
              architectural projects in Rome: designing the Piazza del Campidoglio 
              and the Palazzo Farnese; he also became the chief architect to St 
              Peter's in 1546. </font></p>
            <p class="factsheets"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Michelangelo 
              died in Rome aged eighty-nine, his body was then smuggled to Florence 
              and buried with elaborate honours in S. Croce. No other Italian 
              of the renaissance period is better known to us: his broken-nosed 
              countenance familiar from paintings, drawings, medals and busts 
              (a good example of the latter by Daniele da Volterra is in the Ashmolean 
              Museum, Oxford); numerous letters and the mythologizing biographies 
              of Condivi (1553) and Vasari (1550 and 1564) providing much material 
              to analyse his character. Michelangelo's influence was enormous 
              even without a formal school to continue and promulgate his style, 
              due in large part to the large number of reproductive engravings 
              taken from his works (a good selection of these are in the Department). 
              Copies after his work by artists as diverse as Sir Peter Paul Rubens 
              and William Blake in the Museum's collection give some idea of his 
              lasting influence. Michelangelo was perhaps the most brilliant draughtsman 
              of the male nude ever to have lived, and it is perhaps this aspect 
              of his work that had the most durable legacy as his idealised vision 
              of the male form became enshrined in the academic art tradition 
              throughout Europe well into the last century. </font></p>
