            <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#666666"><strong><font color="#000066" size="3">William 
              Hogarth (1697-1764)</font></strong></font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#000000">From 
              an apprenticeship to a silver engraver and training in the informal 
              drawing academies of the day (one of which was run by Sir James 
              Thornhill, Sergeant Painter to the King, whose daughter Jane he 
              married), William Hogarth became the leading artist of his generation. 
              The advancement of his own career went hand-in-hand with a wider 
              promotion of British art. In 1735 he set up a drawing academy in 
              St. Martin's Lane, London, which for thirty years was run on a co-operative 
              basis and formed a focus for the development of the rococo style 
              in Britain; in the same year he was largely responsible for the 
              passing of the Engravers' Copyright Act; in 1736 and 1737 he gave 
              two large-scale paintings, <i>The Pool of Bethesda</i> and <i>The 
              Good Samaritan</i>, to St. Bartholomew's Hospital (where they still 
              hang) in order to demonstrate that a British artist was capable 
              of historical composition on a grand scale; in the 1740s his gifts 
              of paintings to the Foundling Hospital helped to establish it as 
              a place where artists could exhibit their work to the public. His 
              last years, however, were dogged by disputes with younger artists 
              largely caused by his opposition to plans for a British royal academy. 
              In 1753 he published his controversial treatise <i>The Analysis 
              of Beauty</i> the manuscript material for which can be read in the 
              British Library (Egerton MSS.3100-16).<img src="images/hogarth.jpg" width="300" height="245" align="right" vspace="10" hspace="10" alt="A Harlot's Progress"></font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#000000">Hogarth 
              was equally important as a painter and as an engraver and he derived 
              a large income from publishing engraved versions of his paintings. 
              Although a fine portrait-painter, he is best remembered for his 
              'Modern Moral Subjects', combining a rococo style with satirical 
              comment on contemporary society. His first great success in this 
              genre came in 1732 with <i>A Harlot's Progress</i>. One thousand 
              two hundred and forty sets of the first edition were sold at one 
              guinea (£1.05) each.<br>

            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#000000">Hogarth's 
              paintings were mainly worked direct on to the canvas and his studies 
              from life often took the form of thumbnail sketches. Only about 
              one hundred drawings survive, and more than half of these belong 
              to the British Museum. They have all been entered on the computer 
              database which is available for consultation in the Study Room. 
              No complete catalogue of Hogarth's drawings has been published since 
              A. P. Oppé's<i> The Drawings of William Hogarth</i>, 1948.<br wp="BR1">

              Museum's collection includes all known preliminary drawings for 
              the series<i> Industry and Idleness</i> and the copper plates. There 
              are also drawings by Hogarth in <i>Hogarth's Peregrination</i>, 
              his friend Ebenezer Forrest's manuscript account of a boisterous 
              tour of the Thames estuary undertaken in 1732. </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#000000">Prints 
              by Hogarth can be found in most of the leading museums in the UK, 
              as well as in many smaller collections. Almost all his copper plates 
              survived until the early part of this century and were frequently 
              reprinted, with the consequence that many worn and re-worked impressions 
              exist. The Museum has one of the finest collections of the prints, 
              including rare early impressions, and was used as one of the principal 
              sources for the standard catalogue of prints, Ronald Paulson's <i>Hogarth's 
              Graphic Works</i> (three editions: Yale University Press, 1965, 
              1970; The Print Room, 1989). The main series of Hogarth's prints 
              is arranged according to Paulson, in parallel mounted and unmounted 
              series.</font></p>

              All the important prints and a number of minor examples are on permanent 
              display at Hogarth's summer villa at Chiswick in west London which 
              is open to the public and was refurbished for the tercentenary of 
              his birth in 1997. </font></p>
