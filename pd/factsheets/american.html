              American Collection: Works on Paper </b></font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> The American 
              Collection in the Department of Prints and Drawings ranges from 
              some of the earliest surviving representations of American subjects 
              to twentieth-century evocations of the American scene and the most 
              contemporary forms of artistic expression. The acquisition of material 
              by artists who came from or gravitated towards the United States 
              from the late-nineteenth century onwards, has been a principal objective 
              since the late 1970s. This has been expanded to include artists 
              working in Canada and Latin America. </font> </p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#330066"><b>Drawings</b></font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><br>
              </font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The earliest 
              drawings in the collection are a priceless record by the artist 
              John White (active 1585-1593), of the flora, fauna and native peoples 
              he observed in the course of expeditions for the colonisation of 
              Virginia organised by Sir Walter Raleigh between 1585 and 1590. 
              All the drawings as well as those of non-American subjects were 
              published in facsimile in 1964.</font> 
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Chronologically 
              the next substantial group of drawings of American interest belongs 
              to the history painter, Benjamin West (1738-1820), who arrived in 
              England in 1763, becoming the second President of the Royal Academy 
              in 1792. He was followed to London in 1774 by the Boston portrait 
              painter, John Singleton Copley (1738-1815), by whom the Department 
              owns a book of anatomical drawings made in 1756 at the very beginning 
              of his career. Two other distinguished artists of American origin 
              who spent the greater part of their careers in Europe, were first 
              of all J.A.M. Whistler (1834-1903), who is principally represented 
              by an <i>Amsterdam Nocturne</i> of 1883-84; the only one to remain 
              outside the Freer Collection in Washington, it formerly belonged 
              to Whistler's protégé, the British artist W. R. Sickert. Secondly, 
              there was the fashionable portrait painter John Singer Sargent (1856-1925) 
              by whom the Museum has fourteen drawings including watercolours 
              of Venice, Genoa and the Alhambra in Spain, and a pastel of his 
              friend, the French artist Paul Helleu.</font> 
            <p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">From the early 
              twentieth century there are vivid examples by Abraham Walkowitz 
              (1878-1965) whose <i>City Abstraction </i>of 1912 captures the dynamism 
              of New York, and by the Canadian David Milne (1882-1953), for whom 
              watercolour was his preferred medium; Milne did some of his best 
              work in the United States such as <i>Ferris Wheel, Coney Island,</i> 
              of 1912 and <i>Reflections, Glenmore Hotel </i>(in the Adirondacks) 
              of 1923, both of which have been acquired by the Department. The 
              impact of European Surrealist and Expressionist traditions can be 
              seen in drawings by the French-born artist Louise Bourgeois (b.1911), 
              and the Swiss émigré Hans Burkhardt (1904-1994), who worked with 
              Gorky and de Kooning in New York before moving to California in 
              1937. A clearly identifiable New York School began to emerge from 
              the 1940s onwards, represented by an abstract watercolour of 1944 
              by Hans Hofmann (1880-1966) a large sculptural gouache of 1951 by 
              David Smith (1906-1965), two drawings of 1948-50 by Dorothy Dehner, 
              Smith's first wife, and a brush drawing of 1957 by Franz Kline (1910-1962). 
              In Toronto, a group of artists interested in abstraction exhibited 
              together in the 1950s under the name <i>Painters Eleven</i>, whose 
              work is represented by Oscar Cahén (1916-1956) and Kazuo Nakamura 
              (b.1926). The period from the mid-1960s to the present day is represented 
              with both abstract and figurative work by artists such as Jim Dine, 
              Sol Lewitt, Lawrence Weiner, Joel Shapiro, Jay Defeo, Edda Renouf, 
              and Kiki Smith. </font>

              Department now has the best collection of American prints from the 
              late-nineteenth century up to the mid-1960s of any museum outside 
              the United States. The key factors in the diversity of the material 
              from this period were the inherent vitality of so much American 
              subject matter and a belief in the importance of prints as a means 
              of communication at all levels. Native-born artists and foreigners, 
              narrative artists and abstractionists alike were captivated by the 
              drama and geometry of American urban, industrial and agrarian life, 
              from New York street architecture, to railway goods yards and Mid-Western 
              grain elevators. During the Depression, printmaking was further 
              stimulated by the Federally funded Graphic Arts Divisions run from 
              1935-43 under the Works Progress Administration for the relief of 
              unemployed artists. Political upheavals in Europe brought a stream 
              of émigrés with their own skills and stylistic innovations who further 
              helped to transform the artistic scene in America.</font> 
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1" color="#999999">Left: 
              Louis Lozowick (1892-1973), New York from the El train, around 1925, 
              lithograph, 292 x 229mm, bequeathed by Mrs Kathleen Gray (1993-7-25-58),

            <p>&nbsp; 
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> The Department's 
              collection of prints by modern American artists really began in 
              1863 with the acquisition of its first set of Whistler's etchings 
              from the artist. In 1905 the son of the printer T.R. Way, presented 
              the greater part of Whistler's lithographic output, while Whistler's 
              fervent admirer, Joseph Pennell (1869-1929), also presented much 
              of his own considerable graphic oeuvre. One of the Department's 
              principal benefactors was Campbell Dodgson, the Keeper from 1912-1932, 
              who in 1926 gave four of Edward Hopper's most important etchings, 
              including <i>Night on the El Train </i>of 1918 and<i> Evening Wind</i> 
              of 1921. A cross-section of the work of John Sloan (1871-1951), 
              whose portfolio of 1905-6, <i>New York City Life</i>, was such an 
              inspiration to Hopper in its use of plebeian urban narrative, was 
              presented to the Museum as a single gift from the artist's estate.</font> 
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> The bulk of 
              the collection, however, has been built up by purchase, supplemented 
              by some generous gifts, since 1979. The very favourable public response 
              to an initial exhibition <i>American Prints 1879-1979</i> held in 
              1980, convinced us that this should become a major area of acquisition. 
              Among the wealth of material represented are outstanding groups 
              of work by George Bellows (1882-1925), one of the most forceful 
              American artistic personalities at the beginning of the century; 
              by Hopper's friend, Martin Lewis (1882-1962), who produced haunting 
              images of New York in the shadows; by the numerous people experimenting 
              with screen printing during the 1940s when it was in its infancy 
              as an artistic medium; by the new cosmopolitan body of artists for 
              whom S.W. Hayter's <i>Atelier 17</i> was such a magnet in New York 
              from 1940-1955, when American artists like Jackson Pollock made 
              contact with Europeans like Miró and Masson; and by artists working 
              across the United States in the Mid-West and California. American 
              printmaking from the 1960s is represented by key figures such as 
              Jasper Johns, Robert Rauschenberg, Jim Dine, Roy Lichtenstein, Ed 
              Ruscha, Richard Estes and the leading Minimalist artists. </font>
