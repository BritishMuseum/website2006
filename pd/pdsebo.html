        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Department lends 
          to between 60 and 70 exhibitions every year. The work involved takes 
          up most of the time of three members of staff. The following notes are 
          written to help those who are planning exhibitions, and should answer 
          the most frequently asked questions.</font></p>
        <p></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">1. Objects will 
          only be lent to properly established authorities and to proper venues. 
          They must have a professional staff competent to deal with the administration 
          and handling of loans. Exhibitions must be open to the general public, 
          and should contribute to knowledge and understanding of their subject.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">2. Applications 
          should be made by the organising authority in writing to the Keeper 
          of Prints and Drawings a minimum of six months before the exhibition 
          is due to open. They should explain clearly what the exhibition is about, 
          and why the presence of our work(s) is important for its success. It 
          is not necessary for the organising curator to have discussed the project 
          with a member of Prints and Drawings staff beforehand, and we do not 
          expect or encourage this. However, we do expect the curator of the exhibition 
          to have come to the British Museum and to have seen the works requested; 
          we find it difficult to regard any request as serious where this has 
          not happened. Borrowers should be certain that they have completed their 
          research before writing; additional supplementary requests cause a great 
          deal of extra work and are normally rejected.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">3. Since the Department 
          receives more loan requests than it is able to handle, choices have 
          to be made. We expect to lend to most reasonable requests from venues 
          in the United Kingdom, but to fewer abroad. In the case of foreign loans, 
          we prioritise on the grounds of the importance of our objects to the 
          success of the exhibition, the importance of the exhibition itself, 
          and the quality of the associated catalogue.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">4. Although there 
          is no formal limit to the numbers of works requested, in most circumstances 
          the number will be limited to what one courier is able to carry by hand. 
          Exhibitions may be toured, but the potential length of exposure of any 
          object is limited by the nature of the work and how long it has been 
          exhibited in the past. Only in special circumstances will watercolours 
          be lent to more than two venues, and drawings in other media to more 
          than three. Works will not normally be lent to any single venue for 
          longer than three months.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">5. Loan requests 
          must give full information to enable us to identify and locate the works 
          requested. The register number is essential, but is sufficient in itself 
          only for drawings, which are so far the only part of the collection 
          to be entered on computer. For prints we also need the artist under 
          whose name the work is kept, or the subject series where the work is 
          placed. In most cases we also need to know if the work is mounted or 
          unmounted, and in what size/century/school it is placed; standard catalogue 
          reference numbers are always helpful.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">6. Venues must be 
          able to satisfy the internationally recognised standards of security 
          and protection against fire, and we submit all requests for approval 
          by the National Museums' Security Advisor. Framed works must be screwed 
          to the walls by four mirror plates (our frames come with these attached), 
          and we sometimes require security screws. If works are placed in cases, 
          they must be constructed sturdily, and have high-quality locks. Any 
          further recommendations and stipulations that are made by the National 
          Security Advisor must be adhered to. We particularly draw attention 
          to the fact that smoking is not permitted in the place of exhibition 
          or the adjacent areas, not only during the exhibition but also during 
          mounting and dismounting.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">7. We normally stipulate 
          that the lighting levels in the exhibition do not exceed 80 lux (100 
          lux in the case of black and white prints, and 50 lux for watercolours); 
          that the relative humidity should be maintained at 55% (plus or minus 
          5%); and that the temperature should be maintained at 65 degrees (plus 
          or minus 5 degrees).</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">8. We normally insure 
          works with our own agents, whose conditions of contract we have approved. 
          But we are willing in principle to accept government or state indemnities 
          and insurance offered by borrowers. In these cases we expect to see 
          the precise terms in order to assure ourselves that the cover is adequate 
          and that no exclusion clauses cause us concern. The only exclusion clauses 
          that we will allow are those that exclude loss or damage caused by: 
          </font>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(a) the negligence 
          or other wrongful act of the British Museum or its servants or agents;</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(b) the condition 
          (including inherent vice or pre-existing flaw) of the Objects at the 
          beginning of the Term;</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(c) a third party 
          claiming to be entitled to any Objects;</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(d) repair, restoration, 
          cleaning, conservation or any other work carried out on the Objects 
          by the Borrower or their respective servants or agents where such work 
          is carried out with the British Museum's permission; or</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(e) war, hostilities 
          or war-like operations, but excluding acts of terrorism, riot, civil 
          commotion, piracy and hijacking.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">9. The Trustees 
          always require works to be transported under the care of a courier, 
          who will usually be a member of the British Museum staff or another 
          United Kingdom National Museum. If works are excessively large or numerous, 
          they may be sent framed in crates. Works are hand-carried by preference, 
          in which case frames may be sent out separately in advance. Travelling 
          within the United Kingdom is normally by van or train; in the latter 
          case we require a first class ticket and standard fare when returning. 
          Travel abroad is usually by air, and we require business class tickets 
          when loan objects are being hand-carried in the passenger cabin of an 
          aircraft where this gives access to more space in the cabin.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> In certain circumstances 
          (particularly in transfers between venues of touring exhibitions) and 
          by special arrangement, we may agree to allow the courier to be a member 
          of staff of the borrowing institution. In these cases we require that 
          the courier gives us a personal undertaking to act on our behalf. If 
          Customs require to examine objects, we expect the borrower to make every 
          effort to do this at the exhibition site, not at the point of entry.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">10. All costs that 
          the British Museum incurs in connection with making loans must be met 
          by the borrower. The chief of these are:</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(a) conservation, 
          mounting and packing; we are normally able to supply frames and cases 
          from stock, but conservation and mounting costs are always passed on.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(b) transport, customs, 
          shipping agents and couriers, including travel insurance; normally a 
          courier within Europe will expect to stay two nights, to America three 
          nights, and further abroad longer. The borrower is expected to pay the 
          cost of the hotel and give a <i>per diem</i> sum in cash to cover the 
          courier's expenses.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(c) photography; 
          in addition to any photographs that the borrower may require for his 
          own purposes, the British Museum requires one black-and-white photograph 
          to remain on file as a security record.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(d) administration; 
          we recover the hidden costs of staff time involved in administering 
          the loan on behalf of the borrower. This money is used to pay the salary 
          of an extra member of staff who deals with loans. For works on paper, 
          this fee currently begins at a minimum of £1500 (+VAT) and increases 
          according to the size and complexity of the loan. The administration 
          charge (but not the conservation charge in (a) above) is currently waived 
          for venues within the United Kingdom. (Please note that the charge is 
          not per item, but per operation.)</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">11. The Keeper of 
          the Department has authority to give approval to loans up to a total 
          valuation (per loan, not object) of £1,000,000. Over that value, loans 
          can only be approved by the Trustees, who meet every two months, six 
          times a year, from late January onwards. Borrowers should therefore 
          expect certain delays before securing formal approval. The Keeper is 
          permitted to approve subsequent changes of date and certain changes 
          of content.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">12. Once this approval 
          has been given, borrowers will be required to sign a formal Loan Agreement 
          accepting the British Museum's terms and conditions of loan. In the 
          case of travelling exhibitions, each borrower will be required to sign 
          a separate Agreement. Specimens of this Agreement are available on request.</font></p>
        <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">13. The British Museum 
        normally gives permission for its photographs to be used free of reproduction 
        fees in the catalogue of the exhibition; but a copy of the catalogue (hard-back 
        if available) must be supplied to us on publication. We will also allow 
        our photographs to be freely used for press and publicity purposes, but 
        we will require a reproduction fee (after previous agreement) if they 
        are to be exploited commercially. We do not allow our works to be photographed 
        by the borrower; the only exception is in general shots of the installation, 
        or by television cameras for publicity purposes. In these cases we require 
        that the lighting used be kept to a minimum, and that no cases are opened 
        and the objects are not handled. Photography by the public in the exhibition 
        gallery is not permitted. </font> 
        <p></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">14. We will do our 
          best to complete and return borrowers' loan forms, but we do expect 
          the borrower to have completed as much as possible before they are sent 
          to us. We are not willing to supply cataloguing information (such as 
          medium, size and references) as we expect this to be ascertained by 
          the organising curator before the loan request is made. In order to 
          save staff time, it is our normal practice to compile condition reports 
          on delivery at the destination rather than before departure from London, 
          and to check them before their return; but we will compile such reports 
          in London if required.</font></p>
