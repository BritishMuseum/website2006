                                    1.Babylon is unquestionably one of the most 
                                    important archaeological sites in the world, 
                                    and was the capital city of two of the most 
                                    famous kings of antiquity, Hammurabi (1792-1750 
                                    BC) who introduced the world&#8217;s first 
                                    lawcode, and Nebuchadnezzar (604-562 BC) who 
                                    built the Hanging Gardens of Babylon, one 
                                    of the Seven Wonders of the World. Excavations 
                                    at Babylon during the last 150 years have 
                                    uncovered some parts of the city but much 
                                    remains buried beneath the earth and there 
                                    is still a great deal to discover about the 
                                    ancient city. In view of the historical and 
                                    archaeological significance of Babylon, recent 
                                    allegations of damage to the site during its 
                                    occupation as a military camp are particularly 
                                    serious. It was as a result of these allegations 
                                    that a meeting was arranged at Babylon in 
                                    the period 11 &#8211; 13 December.</font>

                                      The meeting was convened prior to the handover 
                                      of the archaeological site of Babylon by 
                                      the coalition forces to the State Board

                                      15th January 2005. The meeting was supposed 
                                      to include a committee of Iraqi archaeologists,

                                      forces in Babylon, and representatives of 
                                      the coalition forces. UNESCO was asked to 
                                      send a representative, but declined to do 
                                      so for security reasons. I was invited to 
                                      attend as an independent observer by His 
                                      Excellency Mufid al-Jazairi, the Iraqi Minister 
                                      of Culture. Professor MacGuire Gibson of 
                                      the University of Chicago and Professor 
                                      John Russell, formerly the advisor to the 
                                      Minister of Culture, were also invited to

                                      A military camp was first established at 
                                      Babylon by American forces in April 2003. 
                                      Command of the camp was officially handed 
                                      over to Polish forces in September 2003, 
                                      but Polish forces were also present before 
                                      this time. During most of this period infrastructure 
                                      works to support the military camp were 
                                      the responsibility of Kellog, Brown and 
                                      Root (KBR).The camp (150 has) was established 
                                      in the middle of the archaeological site 
                                      (900 has) and surrounded the central enclosed 
                                      part of the ancient city. I was informed 
                                      that the camp had originally contained 2000 
                                      soldiers but that figure had now been reduced 
                                      to less than 400.</font></p>

                                      essentially a condition report, and it contains 
                                      many photographs that provide an invaluable 
                                      record of the state of the site in November 
                                      2004. In my own report (below), frequent 
                                      cross-reference is made to the <em>Polish Report</em>. As it is a condition report,

                                      are included in the <em>Polish Report</em>, 
                                      but they are not highlighted and there is 
                                      no attempt to list them, to describe them 
                                      in detail, to estimate when they occurred 
                                      or to suggest who was responsible.</font></p>

                                      meeting, it was agreed that 3 reports focusing 
                                      on the archaeological site of Babylon should

                                      It should be stressed that my own report 
                                      does not in any way purport to be a comprehensive 
                                      assessment of damage to the site or interference 
                                      with it since its occupation by coalition 
                                      forces. That would be an impossible undertaking 
                                      on the basis of a 2 &frac12; day visit. 
                                      Nevertheless, in my opinion there has been 
                                      substantial damage and listed below are 
                                      examples of this damage. All the following 
                                      instances were pointed out to members of 
                                      the committee during a tour around the site

                                      Raed Hamed. This list should not be seen 
                                      as exhaustive, but is indicative of the 
                                      types of damage caused. Following on from 
                                      the instances of damage pointed out by Dr

                                      may be old spoil-tips, perhaps from the

                                      covered with gravel to create a parking

                                      wheels of heavy vehicles. On the south side 
                                      of this road there were formerly about 100 
                                      tall concrete blocks, to protect the helipad

                                      is in the north-west corner of the camp 
                                      there are 2 trenches, each c.20m long. See

                                      of spoil alongside the trenches there are 
                                      many fragments of brick, some with inscriptions

                                      2. About 200m south-west of the Warsaw Gate 
                                      are HESCO bags protecting an open storage 
                                      area with floodlights that are filled with 
                                      earth containing many fragments of brick,

                                      3. There is a large flat area (no gravel) 
                                      between the Warsaw Gate and Saddam&#8217;s 
                                      Palace on the west side of the road. Now 
                                      only portable toilets are left on this site. 
                                      There is a pile of brick fragments in one 
                                      corner, some of them inscribed.<br>
                                      4. Across this large area there is an east-west 
                                      earth bank, c.1.5m high. The deposited earth 
                                      contains many fragments of inscribed brick.

                                      In the early days after the war, a military 
                                      presence at Babylon served a valuable purpose 
                                      in that it prevented the site from being 
                                      looted. But it is regrettable that a military

                                      but the extent of the levelling operations 
                                      before the gravel was laid down is unclear. 
                                      It is estimated that c.300,000 sq. metres 
                                      of the site have been covered with gravel 
                                      in this way. All the gravel has been brought 
                                      in from elsewhere, and will of course work 
                                      its way into the archaeological deposits. 
                                      This is extremely unfortunate from an archaeological 
                                      point of view, as previously undisturbed 
                                      archaeological deposits on the site will 
                                      now be contaminated. The status of future 
                                      information about these areas will therefore 
                                      be seriously compromised.</font></p>

                                      We were shown about one dozen trenches of 
                                      various sizes and about one dozen cuttings 
                                      into existing tips or mounds, all of which 
                                      appeared to be of recent origin. Some of 
                                      the trenches were clearly cut into previously 
                                      undisturbed archaeological deposits, and 
                                      amongst the spoil from these trenches was 
                                      observed pottery (including a complete vase),

                                      but others have apparently been made into

                                      Around the site there are thousands of sandbags 
                                      and HESCO barriers/conix containers (gigantic 
                                      fabric bags in wire mesh containers that 
                                      are filled with earth or sand). Originally 
                                      these sandbags and HESCO barriers were apparently 
                                      filled with earth scooped up from the Babylon 
                                      archaeological site, and the presence of 
                                      sherds and bones in the bags is a testimony 
                                      to the archaeological nature of the deposits 
                                      used. I was informed that on 3rd November 
                                      2003, an order was issued requiring that 
                                      the bags should only be filled with sand 
                                      and earth brought in from outside Babylon, 
                                      but this is in effect substituting one problem 
                                      for another. By bringing in large quantities 
                                      of sand and earth from elsewhere (some of 
                                      these probably in themselves archaeological 
                                      deposits), the deposits at Babylon will 
                                      be irrevocably contaminated.</font></p>

                                      In many parts of the site are wheel marks 
                                      deriving from the movement of heavy vehicles. 
                                      These ruts and depressions are in themselves 
                                      a source of damage, but more worrying is 
                                      the extent to which heavy vehicle movements 
                                      on the surface will have damaged fragile 
                                      archaeological remains below. Without further 
                                      investigation the nature of this damage 
                                      cannot be qualified or quantified, but the 
                                      movement of heavy vehicles on the surface 
                                      is generally regarded as very bad practice 
                                      on an archaeological site. </font></p>

                                      apply to helicopter movements, which are 
                                      likely to be harmful to fragile archaeological
