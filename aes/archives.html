      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> The existence of 
        the outstanding collection of Egyptian antiquities held by the Department 
        of Ancient Egypt and Sudan is well-known to the general public. Far less 
        familiar is the amount and variety of archival material within the department 
        relating to its collections. With a new, purpose-built, dedicated archive 
        room constructed last summer and plans to catalogue and conserve the material, 
        making it more accessible for future study, we hope to rectify this situation. 
        </font></p>
      <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> The core documents 
        are concerned with the acquisition of the objects in the museum's collection. 
        These records were kept in a series of bound register books which contain 
        lists of groups of antiquities either donated or purchased. Unfortunately, 
        at present, it is very difficult to access this material, except through 
        the year of entry. To complicate matters the acquisitions were not always 
        even consistently entered year by year.</font></p>
      <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> The department holds 
        lists which detail some of the major collections of antiquities which 
        entered the museum in the nineteenth century, including those of Henry 
        Salt (1780-1827), Joseph Sams (1784-1860), and Giovanni Anastasi (the 
        Swedish-Norwegian consul-general in Egypt between 1828 and 1857, whose 
        objects were purchased in 1839). In addition there is information on the 
        Earl of Belmore's collection, acquired by the museum in 1843, and on objects 
        from the collections of W.R. Hamilton (1777-1859), A.C. Harris (1790-1869), 
        and the Egyptologist J.G. Wilkinson (1797-1875). Some information also 
        exists on collections which were offered to the museum but not actually 
        purchased. There are even earlier papers from the eighteenth century relating 
        to the bequest of Col. William Lethieullier in 1775. He had visited Egypt 
        in 1721 and he and his nephew gave the museum its first two mummies. Other 
        material from early Egyptologists and travellers includes two notebooks 
        belonging to William John Bankes (1786-1855), describing his travels and 
        discoveries in Egypt and Nubia in 1818-19. Bankes brought back an obelisk 
        from the Temple of Philae which he erected in the garden of his Dorset 
        house, and he and his companions copied inscriptions, both Greek and hieroglyphic, 
        and were the first travellers to draw the interior of the Great Temple 
        at Abu Simbel. Another manuscript is a travel journal of a trip up the 
        Nile into Nubia made by John Shae Perring (1813-1869). Perring assisted 
        Howard Vyse in the surveying and recording of the pyramids of Giza in 
        1837. Information gleaned from the documents of early travellers and excavators 
        may be immensely valuable because, when describing or drawing monuments 
        or copying inscriptions, they often preserved evidence of details and 
        structures which are now damaged or entirely lost, and their journals 
        may sometimes reveal the previously unknown provenance of objects now 
        in the museum. At the time when many of the antiquities were removed from 
        their sites in Egypt and Nubia it was not yet realised how important it 
        would be to note the exact place and context in which an object had been 
        discovered. </font> </p>
