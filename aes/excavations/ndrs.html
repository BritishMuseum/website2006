        with Egypt archaeology in Sudan is still in its infancy. Although Sudan's 
        archaeological heritage rivals that of its northern neighbour it boasts 
        few of the grandiose and extremely well preserved monuments such as those 
        constructed by the pharaohs of ancient Egypt. Today there is increasing 
        interest in Sudan and its pivotal role as the zone of contact between 
        the civilisations of the Mediterranean Basin and the Levant and those 
        of Central Africa is attracting considerable attention.</font></font>

      <p><a name="RTFToC2"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3"><b><font color="#000066" size="2">The 
        Northern Dongola Reach Survey</font></b></font></a><br>
        <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Any map of the Nile 
        Valley in Egypt will show an unbroken chain of ancient settlements along 
        the whole length of the valley from the First Cataract to the Delta. By 
        contrast archaeological maps of the Sudanese Nile valley show a number 
        of large areas devoid of settlement. Prior to the 1990s one such area 
        was on the east bank of the river in the <a href="ndrsmap2.html" target="_self">Northern 
        Dongola Reach</a> 500km north of Khartoum where, for a distance of approximately 
        80km, only the site of Kawa was known. It is increasingly becoming clear 
        that a gap in the distribution of archaeological sites reflects, not an 
        absence of ancient settlement but an absence of archaeological work. In 
        1993 the Sudan Archaeological Research Society obtained a concession from 
        the Sudan National Corporation for Antiquities and Museums to undertake 
        survey on the east bank of the Nile in the Northern Dongola Reach between 
        Mulwad and Eimani, from the river eastwards to the edge of the desert 
        plateau, a maximum distance of 18km. To the south a similar survey had 
        been conducted in the 1980s by the Royal Ontario Museum, Toronto, while 
        to the north the Section Fran&ccedil;aise de la Direction des Antiquit&eacute;s 
        of the National Corporation for Antiquities and Museums has been surveying 
        and excavating for many years. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The <a href="ndrsmap.html" target="_self">SARS 
        project</a> rapidly filled the gap on the distribution map with the location, 
        over a five year period, of 450 sites. Although some of these were little 
        more that occupation scatters approximately 50 substantial cemeteries 
        of the later Neolithic period (<i>c</i>. 5500 - 3500 BC) were recorded 
        (see picture 1) and 150 rural settlements of the Kerma period (<i>c</i>. 
        2500 - 1500 BC) (see picture 2). What proved to be the most exciting discovery 
        was illustrated by the distribution of the sites over time. In the Neolithic 
        sites were widely distributed across the alluvial plain, being located 
        not only close to the banks of the present river but well to the east 
        up to the edge of the plateau. </font></p>

              around 2500 BC a major political centre developed at Kerma 35km 
              to the north of the SARS concession. This, the capital of the Kingdom 
              of Kush, rose to rival the power of Egypt and ultimately posed such 
              a threat to the pharaohs as to necessitate its conquest around 1500 
              BC. The Kerma period, as it is called by archaeologists, appears 
              to have been the most productive time in the Northern Dongola Reach. 
              The needs of the large metropolis, the capital of a kingdom which 
              in its heyday stretched from the Fourth to the First Cataracts, 
              will have served to stimulate the local economy to produce a surplus 
              which would either have been marketed or have been drawn off as 
              tax in kind to Kerma. The 150 settlements are a physical testimony 
              to this intensive utilisation of the region. Unlike in the Neolithic 
              these sites are confined to the banks of the present day Nile and 
              to the banks of a number of palaeochannels - old river channels 
              - some running well to the east of the Nile. In places these palaeochannels 
              are extremely well preserved with the river bed approximately 70m 
              wide and 2m deep clearly visible and lined on both banks with the 
              large and prominent settlement mounds. The SARS project was one 
              of survey, recording surface features in most cases, and therefore 
              details of the layout of these settlements were rarely visible.</font></p>

              number of mud-brick buildings were noted and many structures of 
              a highly unusual, and at that time totally unknown type. These structures 
              were rectangular, up to 11m square, and were characterised by an 
              internal arrangement of stone `post-pads, set approximately 1m apart 
              (see picture 3). These are too close together to have been needed 
              to support timber posts to hold up the roof and it was suggested 
              that they supported a raised timber floor. For the safe storage 
              of foodstuffs in northern Sudan it is essential to protect against 
              termites, rodents and from damp. A number of ethnographic parallels 
              for raising the storage facility of the ground on wooden posts are 
              still to be seen in Sudan and one is forcibly reminded of the provision 
              of raised floors in store buildings/granaries belonging to other 
              cultures particularly granaries in Roman forts. One problem with 
              this interpretation appeared to be the difficulty of procuring the 
              large quantities of timber necessary to produce this raised floor 
              in this arid landscape. However, as already noted the climate was 
              probably considerable wetter during the Kerma period and recent 
              excavations by the University of Charles de Gaulle III, Lille at 
              the nearby site of Gism el-Arba, Settlement 2, directed by Brigitte 
              Gratien, has found similar buildings with the remains of the timber 
              floors still preserved.</font></p>

        conquest of the Northern Dongola Reach by the pharaohs of the Egyptian 
        18<sup>th</sup> Dynasty was not the only disaster to befall the region 
        in the later 2<sup>nd</sup> and 1<sup>st</sup> millennia BC. The increasingly 
        arid climate along with the drying up of the palaeochannels brought about 
        a fundamental change in the utilisation of the region. Faced with the 
        increasingly inhospitable conditions the number of settlements decreased 
        drastically and attempts were made, through the large scale digging of 
        wells to maintain a presence away from the river. We can envisage the 
        abandonment of agriculture and permanent settlements with a change over 
        to a transhuming or nomadic existence based on animal husbandry which 
        itself became untenable as the Sahara swept over the region. Thereafter, 
        until the recent past all settlement in the Northern Dongola Reach has 
        been confined to the banks of the Nile.</font></p>
