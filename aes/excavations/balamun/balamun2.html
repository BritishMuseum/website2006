        <h3> <b><font face="Arial,Helvetica" size="2">Egypt and the Tell el-Balamun 
          Excavation since 1991</font></b></h3>
        <font face="Arial,Helvetica" size="2">After ten years' work in El-Ashmunein, 
        Jeffrey Spencer went on to direct excavation at the site known as Tell 
        el-Balamun in the northern Nile Delta. This huge and relatively intact 
        stratified archaeological mound marks the position of Behdet or Sma-Behdet, 
        the northernmost city of Pharaonic Egypt, established by 2400 BC and continuously 
        occupied down to the beginning of the sixth century AD. The mound is over 
        a kilometre in diameter and rises to a maximum elevation of nearly eighteen 
        metres above the surrounding agricultural land. In antiquity it was a 
        port on the estuary of a branch of the Nile, but the advance of the Delta 
        coastline means that the site now lies some fifteen kilometres from the 
        sea. By the New Kingdom the town had acquired the additional name of Paiuenamon, 
        "The Island of the [god] Amun", from which 'Balamun' is derived.</font> 
        <font size="2"><br>
        &nbsp; </font>
        <p><font face="Arial,Helvetica" size="2">Excavation began in 1991 and 
          has continued each Spring since. As a city-mound in the fertile land 
          of the Nile Delta, excavation at Tell el-Balamun is very different from 
          work on the desert sites of Egypt, the ground being compact and muddy. 
          Having attracted only limited attention from previous excavators, so 
          little was known about this site that it proved possible to make major 
          discoveries very rapidly. Chief among these were the following:</font> 
          <font size="2"><br>
          &nbsp; </font>
        <p><font face="Arial,Helvetica" size="2">The finding of three <a href="balencs.html">enclosure 
          walls</a> of sun-dried bricks which surround the temple area. The largest 
          of these, over twenty metres in thickness and enclosing an area of 16,000 
          square metres, dates from the Thirtieth Dynasty or about 360 BC. Within 
          it on an only slightly smaller perimeter is an earlier wall from around 
          650 BC, with ruins of a brick-built <a href="balcit.html">citadel </a>at 
          the south corner. Subsequently, an enclosure of the Ramesside Period 
          was discovered closer to the temple of Amun. The processional approach 
          to this temple from the entrances of the enclosures of the Twenty-sixth 
          and Thirtieth Dynasties was later overbuilt by a <a href="balstreet.html">paved 
          street in the Roman Period</a>, for secular use.</font> 
        <p><font face="Arial,Helvetica" size="2">The remains of three destroyed 
          temples inside the Late-Period enclosures. The plans of these had to 
          be recovered from the outlines of their vast sand-filled foundations. 
          Buried in the foundation sand was crucial dating evidence in the form 
          of several foundation deposits containing small objects inscribed with 
          the royal names of the founders. These temples comprise:</font> 
        <p><font face="Arial,Helvetica" size="2"><a href="balamtem.html">the main 
          temple of the god Amun</a></font> <font size="2"><br>
          <font face="Arial,Helvetica"><a href="balsubtem.html">subsidiary temples 
          of Psamtik I and Nectanebo I</a></font></font> 
        <p><font face="Arial,Helvetica" size="2">A small <a href="balcem.html">elite 
          cemetery</a>, discovered unexpectedly at the front of the main temple 
          site, a location usually reserved for the burial of important persons. 
          Some of the tombs were built of sun-dried bricks but other contained 
          chambers or coffins of limestone. They were excavated with great difficulty 
          since they had been entered by subsoil water, the level of which has 
          risen since antiquity. The burials date from between 900 and 700 BC 
          and had been equipped with fine sets of inner coffins decorated with 
          gold leaf.</font>

          available.</font> <font size="2"><br>
