      <blockquote><a NAME="Amun"></a><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size="2">The 
        temple of Amun at Tell el-Balamun</font></font></b></blockquote>
      <blockquote><font face="Arial,Helvetica" size="2">The principal temple of 
        the site was dedicated to the god Amun. Excavation has revealed three 
        stages of building interspersed with periods of neglect and demolition. 
        Throughout the various stages the temple remained on the same spot, with 
        the consequence that the later structures cut into those of earlier date. 
        This process provided the essential features necessary to discover the 
        sequence of building through the detailed observation of the way in which 
        older ruins had been either buried under later deposits of material or 
        cut by new foundations. The oldest temple of which we have evidence on 
        the site dated from the Nineteenth Dynasty (1295-1186 BC), but nothing 
        remained in place of the original stone building. Its position could be 
        determined only by the discovery of the associated wall of sun-dried brick 
        which had surrounded the temple. This wall, with a thickness of over eleven 
        metres, has been traced by excavation on three sides of the temple and 
        the location of its gateways established. The only stone element to have 
        survived from this Nineteenth-Dynasty temple was the lower part of a colossal 
        statue of king Ramesses II with the god Amun and the goddess Mut, found 
        re-used in the construction of a much later gateway. An inscription on 
        this statue gives the early name of the city, <i>Sma-Behdet.</i></font> 
        <p><font face="Arial,Helvetica" size="2">More substantial remains were 
          recovered from the rebuilding of the temple in the period between 825 
          and 550 BC. Building seems to have been commenced under king Sheshonq 
          III (825-773 BC), who constructed a large pylon gateway at the front 
          of his new temple. Small objects placed under the foundation of this 
          gate as part of the ritual of establishing a new building - known as 
          foundation deposits - were found to be inscribed with the name of the 
          king. The royal name on the deposits appeared with that of the Fan Bearer, 
          Hor, one of the highest officials of the time. The foundations of temples 
          of this period were entirely filled with clean sand, much of which remained 
          in place, so by following the extent of the sand it was possible to 
          trace the ground-plan of the building, despite the fact that all the 
          above-ground masonry had been quarried away in later periods.</font><font size="2"><br>

      <blockquote><font face="Arial,Helvetica" size="2">The temple of Sheshonq 
        III was enlarged by the kings of the Twenty-Sixth Dynasty (664-525 BC) 
        by the addition at the front of a colonnaded approach and another huge 
        pylon gate, seventy-five metres wide, one of the largest known in Egypt. 
        Of this, again, only the sand foundation-bed remains and unfortunately 
        in this case no foundation deposits were preserved to identify the builder 
        more precisely. It is probable that this stage was initiated by king Psamtik 
        I (664-610 BC) who is known to have been active at Tell el-Balamun, building 
        a small temple in the southern part of the site and a new enclosure wall 
        around the entire sacred area.</font> 
        <p><font face="Arial,Helvetica" size="2">The stratigraphy of the site 
          indicates that the whole of the temple of Amun was completely demolished 
          sometime after the end of the Twenty-Sixth Dynasty in 525 BC. The former 
          sacred site was then encroached upon by secular activities, such as 
          the construction of pottery kilns and the cutting of rubbish-pits, and 
          languished neglected until the temple was rebuilt once more under king 
          Nekhtnebef (380-362 BC).The back of this new temple lay directly over 
          the former position of that built by Sheshonq III, but the discovery 
          of a foundation deposit of Nekhtnebef at the rear corner of the building 
          shows that the whole structure must have been rebuilt from foundation 
          level. At the front, the earlier arrangement of a colonnaded approach 
          and a great pylon was abandoned and instead Nekhtnebef's temple had 
          a simple rectangular courtyard within a plain wall of limestone about 
          two metres in thickness. On the east side of this courtyard a raised 
          terrace of mud-brick was constructed as the base for some kind of chapel, 
          and to the west of the temple a separate sand-bed foundation, discovered 
          in 1998, seems to have been intended for the Mammisi. A granite shrine 
          was placed in the sanctuary but never inscribed and fragments of it 
          are visible at the site today. The temple-building programme of the 
          Thirtieth Dynasty at Balamun was so ambitious, including not just the 
          reconstruction of the main temple but also the addition of a subsidiary 
          temple and the building of the latest enclosure wall, that it is not 
          surprising that some elements were never completed. From the evidence 
          of rubbish-pits cut into the area of the temple forecourt, it seems 
          that the temple of Amun, at least, had ceased to function by the end 
          of the Ptolemaic Period.</font>
