      <blockquote><a NAME="Elitecem"></a><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size="2">The 
        elite cemetery of dynasty 22 at the front of the main temple</font></font></b></blockquote>
      <blockquote><font face="Arial,Helvetica" size="2">Placing the tombs of important 
        individuals at the front of major temples was a practice of the Third 
        Intermediate Period and Late Period, the most famous examples of which 
        are the royal tombs at Tanis. In the 1998 and 1999 seasons at Tell el-Balamun, 
        a small cluster of tombs dating from the Twenty-second Dynasty was found 
        in front of the temple of Amun, just to the west of the axis. Three tombs 
        remained identifiable, although there was evidence that there may originally 
        have been at least two more. First to be discovered was the brick-built 
        tomb of a Lower Egyptian Vizier, named Iken, who had been equipped with 
        fairly lavish burial goods for the period. Although partly robbed in antiquity, 
        there remained a considerable quantity of gold leaf from the embellishment 
        of the coffin, much of it in the form of narrow strips from a headdress. 
        A pair of bronze-framed inlaid eyes were found, once fitted to the mask 
        of the coffin. Several amuletic figurines of deities were found on the 
        body, together with&nbsp; a granite heart scarab which bore not only the 
        names of Iken and his mother, but also the cartouche of King Osorkon I 
        (924-889 BC). This provided a welcome piece of fixed dating evidence. 
        To the south of the head lay three stone vases and a whole array of glazed 
        faience shabti-figures, which were excavated with difficulty from the 
        hard mud. Each figure bore the name of Iken in black paint.</font></blockquote>

      <blockquote><font face="Arial,Helvetica" size="2"><img src="balamun32.jpg" border=0 height=209 width=300 align=RIGHT vspace="10" hspace="5">To 
        the east of the tomb of Iken lay a second tomb of mud-brick, but it proved 
        to be empty of any burials. The interior had been dug out in the sixth 
        century BC and subsequently cut by a large rubbish pit of Ptolemaic date. 
        Further east was a third tomb containing three burials, a young adult 
        male (Burial 3/i), an older male (Burial 3/ii), and a child (Burial 3/iii). 
        The younger man lay in a stone-lined chamber which had been constructed 
        within the brickwork of the tomb. Unfortunately, on lifting the roofing-blocks, 
        the chamber was found to have been entirely flooded by subsoil water, 
        which had to be removed during the excavation. The body lay extended on 
        its back with the head to the west and the arms crossed on the chest. 
        Crystallised salts in the water had preserved the imprint of linen mummification 
        wrappings and the grain of wood from a coffin. As further evidence, two 
        pairs of bronze eyes from inlays in coffins were found. At the foot of 
        the chamber was a set of limestone Canopic Jars and a pottery vessel, 
        all uninscribed. This burial was separated by a narrow brick wall from 
        another to the north, where the body of the older man was found lying 
        in a limestone sarcophagus. The lid had been broken at the time of burial 
        and the breaks patched with stone fragments, but in spite of Ptolemaic 
        pits having been dug down to the top of the coffin, it had not been disturbed. 
        Like the burial in the first chamber, it had been damaged by water, but 
        once again the inlaid eyes from the coffins were recovered.&nbsp;More 
        significant was the finding of an additional pair of inlaid eyes in the 
        form of those of a falcon, together with a bronze falcon beak, illustrated 
        here. These remains show that one of the three coffins of this individual 
        was equipped with a falcon-faced mask, a very rare fashion known to have 
        been shared by only three other individuals from ancient Egypt, all belonging 
        to the royal family of Dynasty 22: King Osorkon II, King Sheshonq II and 
        the High-Priest of Amun Harsiese. In the final burial in tomb 3 at Balamun, 
        that of the child, the finding of another bronze beak showed that this 
        burial had also possessed a falcon-mask coffin. The body of the child 
        was contained in a rectangular limestone sarcophagus, placed at a higher 
        level and on a different orientation from the others. This suggests that 
        its addition to the tomb may have been the result of an unexpected, early 
        death. On the floor of the sarcophagus the imprint of the inner coffin 
        was visible. To merit burial so close to the temple and to have coffins 
        with falcon-masks, the occupants of the Balamun tombs must have been of 
        high status, probably priests of the temple and relatives of the royal 
        family of the Twenty-Second Dynasty.</font></blockquote>
