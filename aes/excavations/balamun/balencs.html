      <blockquote><font size="2"><a NAME="Encwall"></a><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The 
        enclosure walls of the temple area</font></b> <br>
        <font face="Arial,Helvetica">Three mud-brick enclosure walls around the 
        temple area at Tell el-Balamun have been discovered, all with the same 
        purpose of protecting the sacred space but constructed at different periods. 
        The earliest was built in the late Nineteenth or the Twentieth Dynasty 
        and surrounded a relatively small area around the main temple. A gap some 
        53m wide in the front wall of this enclosure indicates the location of 
        the vanished Ramesside pylon of the temple. This enclosure was originally 
        150m wide but was extended to the south east in the Third Intermediate 
        Period by the addition of a new section. The Ramesside wall is the oldest 
        feature so far discovered at the site and the sole evidence for the position 
        of the temple of this age, all of which was removed by later building 
        activity.</font></font></blockquote>
      <blockquote><font face="Arial,Helvetica" size="2">The later enclosures were 
        built on a much larger scale than that of the Ramesside period, and, with 
        sides around 400m long, surround a region of about 160,000 square metres 
        to&nbsp; include not only the main temple of Amun but certain subsidiary 
        temples within their perimeter. The inner wall probably dates from the 
        Twenty-sixth Dynasty, very likely the reign of Psamtik I (about 650 BC), 
        to whom one of the subsidiary temples certainly belonged. In the south 
        corner of this enclosure lay massive building which served as some type 
        of citadel. Many parts of this wall have been excavated, including the 
        gate in the centre of the north-east side. The wall thickness varies from 
        10 to 12 metres at different points, and it is all built of mixed mud- 
        and sandy bricks over 40cm in length. The brickwork on the exterior of 
        the south corner was found to have been clad with slabs of white limestone, 
        but no evidence was preserved of similar treatment at the other corners 
        of this enclosure.</font></blockquote>

      <blockquote><font face="Arial,Helvetica" size="2">In the Thirtieth Dynasty 
        the temple complex was reconstructed by King Nectanebo I (about 360 BC), 
        who built a new and yet more massive enclosure wall. This has a slightly 
        greater perimeter than&nbsp; the Twenty-sixth Dynasty wall having been 
        constructed only a few metres outside it all around the perimeter. The 
        replacement enclosure was built with some haste, evident from the method 
        of construction, in which no uniform level foundation was prepared. Instead, 
        the bricks followed the contours of the ground as required, in most areas 
        laid directly on the ground surface with only a minimal foundation, but 
        occasionally trenched in quite deeply as localised regions of higher ground 
        were encountered. A cross-section between the two walls at the front of 
        the enclosure revealed that the layers of accumulated fill against the 
        exterior of the inner wall passed below the foundation course of the outer 
        wall, confirming the chronological sequence of the two enclosures. Much 
        of the Thirtieth Dynasty wall is visible as a pale band on the ground 
        surface. Excavation revealed different parts with thicknesses ranging 
        from 18m to 25m. In the north-east side is&nbsp; a very wide gap for the 
        entrance, 125m across, perhaps intended to have been filled by a monumental 
        pylon which was never actually achieved. There was also a smaller gate 
        through the north-western side of the enclosure, in line with the approach 
        to the subsidiary temple of King Nekhtnebef.The corners of the enclosures 
        point approximately towards the cardinal points of the compass, so a pair 
        of crossing lines drawn across the temenos through its corners would be 
        aligned very close to north-south and east-west.</font></blockquote>
