        The Pharaonic Inscriptions</b></font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The following is a 
        summary of an article by Vivian Davies, Keeper of Egyptian Antiquities 
        in the British Museum, in <i>Sudan and Nubia</i> 2 (1998)</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In February 1998, 
        a small archaeological expedition, organised under the joint auspices 
        of the British Museum and the Sudan Archaeological Research Society, visited 
        the site of Kurgus in the Northern Sudan for twelve days. The aims were 
        to make a preliminary survey of the site and to assess its current state 
        and future potential. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><img src="../images/kurgus.jpg" width="300" height="213" align="right" vspace="5" hspace="5" alt="Kurgus Image 1">Kurgus 
        is located between the Fourth and Fifth Cataracts of the Nile, on the 
        east bank of the Nile, about 520 km north of Khartoum and 40 km south 
        of Abu Hamed. It is best known for a petroglyph station, called in Arabic 
        Hagr el-Merwa, 'rock of quartz', famous for bearing the two boundary stelae 
        of Kings Thutmose I and III of the early 18th dynasty and other Egyptian 
        inscriptions (see adjacent photograph). </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Situated at the edge 
        of the desert, the Hagr el-Merwa is a substantial quartz outcrop, with 
        a maximum height of 23.6 m. It is decorated with inscriptions along the 
        length of its north-east face and on a small section of its south-west 
        face, the majority of them lightly hammered in the intractable rock, and 
        some inscribed in red paint. We were able to identify over fifty individual 
        inscriptions, substantially more than had previously been documented. 
        Some proved to be very difficult to spot and it is possible that further 
        examples await discovery. Few are clearly legible throughout; most are 
        eroded and now incomplete. To achieve a satisfactory record will require 
        a second, extended visit to the site and a great deal more research. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><img src="../images/kurgus1.jpg" width="300" height="193" align="left" vspace="5" hspace="5" alt="Kurgus Image 2">The 
        most important decoration, including the royal stelae, occurs at the southern 
        end of the north-east face of the rock. Occupying the prime spot, with 
        the best surface, several metres above the ground, is a tableau showing 
        a seated figure of the Nubian Amun-Ra, ram-headed, facing a serekh containing 
        the Horus name of king Thutmose l; the scene surmounts four horizontal 
        lines of inscription, the hieroglyphs reading from right to left, consisting 
        of a threat formula warning of dire consequences for 'any Nubian who shall 
        transgress this stela'. A near-duplicate of this tableau, inscribed with 
        the Horus-name of Thutmose III, is located at a slightly lower level to 
        its left on a much less suitable surface, where much of the detail of 
        the god's figure, virtually invisible except at very close range, has 
        been rendered simply in red paint. The adjacent photo shows this being 
        recorded. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The remains of two 
        lines of another historical inscription have also been noted. Arranged 
        horizontally, it begins with a year-date, read tentatively as year 35 
        by Vercoutter, and ends with an illegible cartouche, which he was inclined 
        to attribute to Thutmose III rather than Amenhotep III. I believe the 
        numerals may perhaps be better read as 44, which would leave Thutmose 
        III as the sole Eighteenth Dynasty candidate, though Ramesses II of the 
        Nineteenth Dynasty should also be included in the reckoning. Note that 
        immediately below the main Thutmose I tableau are two cartouches, now 
        very faint, which Arkell assumed contained the names of Thutmose I. In 
        fact, they bear the names of Ramesses II, the prenomen, Usermaatrasetepenra, 
        though damaged, being quite clear under the right lighting conditions. 
        This is the first definite Ramesside attestation at Kurgus and extends 
        the New Kingdom history of the site by 150 years or so; it is also the 
        first concrete evidence for a Ramesside presence this far up-river. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Two inscriptions 
        on the south-west face mention royal women. The first is the royal title 
        and name in cartouche of the chief wife of Thutmose I, in red paint, finely 
        done but now faded: 'Great royal wife, Ahmose, may she live' Near the 
        previous, is a similar inscription for the 'King's daughter, [name in 
        cartouche unclear], may she live.' </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Non-royal inscriptions 
        are to be found sporadically along the entire length of the rock's north-east 
        face, a few even intruding into the royal area, though the majority are 
        located towards the northern end. All are written in the hieroglyphic 
        script, usually in vertical columns, reading from right to left. They 
        consist largely of names and titles - of officials and priests - though 
        some are longer and give a certain amount of biographical information. 
        Those that can be certainly dated are Thutmoside; others may be later. 
        Further research is required on this point. For the most part, the inscriptions 
        are located at head-height or below, though a few are placed slightly 
        higher. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Our new epigraphic 
        survey of the Hagr el-Merwa has proved to be a most worthwhile exercise, 
        allowing errors to be eliminated from the existing record and adding substantially 
        to the corpus of inscriptions and to the history of the site. A full assessment 
        of the material will have to wait on further documentation and study, 
        which ideally should go hand-in-hand with excavation of the nearby fortress 
        and cemetery. We can already confirm, however, that the Hagr el-Merwa 
        was no simple graffiti-station casually patronised by passing traders 
        or desert travellers. The inscriptions mention the highest in the land, 
        members of their entourage, and a host of priests and other functionaries. 
        This striking landmark, situated between desert and cultivation, was a 
        place of great political and sacred import, marking the southern boundary 
        of Egypt's empire and of the ordered world, as delimited by the king of 
        the gods.</font></p>
