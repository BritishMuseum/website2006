      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Compared with Egypt 
        archaeology in Sudan is still in its infancy. Although Sudan's archaeological 
        heritage rivals that of its northern neighbour it boasts few of the grandiose 
        and extremely well preserved monuments such as those constructed by the 
        pharaohs of ancient Egypt. Today there is increasing interest in Sudan 
        and its pivotal role as the zone of contact between the civilisations 
        of the Mediterranean Basin and the Levant and those of Central Africa 
        is attracting considerable attention. </font> </p>
      <h2><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#000066">Kawa</font></h2>
      <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Dating from this period 
      of climatic stress is the ancient town of Kawa which lies on the right bank 
      of the River Nile 100km upstream of the Third Cataract in the Dongola Reach. 
      The settlement occupies, or has formed, a prominent mound covering approximately 
      40 hectares. It is one of the largest and most important archaeological 
      sites in Sudan with a long history spanning at least from the 14<sup>th</sup> 
      century BC into the 4<sup>th</sup> century AD. However it stands in an even 
      more ancient landscape. Neolithic pottery is scattered in the plain immediately 
      to the east while a large cemetery of the Kerma Kingdom (2500 - 1500 BC) 
      lies a little to the north east. </font> 
      <p> 
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> The ruins have been 
        a focus of British interest during three centuries; the earliest recorded 
        excavations being those conducted by Colonel Colthorne and his troops, 
        members of the Gordon Relief Expedition, in 1885. They uncovered, during 
        the course of a days digging a small temple with painted walls but the 
        advent of the all too frequent sandstorms over the next two days filled 
        in the efforts of their labours, and they abandoned the enterprise. </font> 
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Major excavations 
        were undertaken at Kawa by the Oxford Excavations in Nubia expedition 
        led by Professor Francis Llewellyn Griffith from 1929-31 and, after his 
        death, by M. F. Laming Macadam and Laurence Kirwan in the winter of 1935-6. 
        Although on a large scale, much of the site remains to be investigated 
        and at no point were the earliest deposits reached. The oldest artefacts 
        found were of the Kerma period but no structural evidence of that date 
        was revealed. Kawa lay within the area conquered by the Egyptian pharaohs 
        of the XVIII<sup>th</sup> dynasty, particularly through the efforts of 
        Thutmose I and Thutmose III in the early to mid 15<sup>th</sup> century 
        BC. Epigraphic evidence indicates that the Egyptian town at Kawa was called 
        Gematon `The Aten is Perceived' and this strongly suggests that a settlement 
        was founded (or re-founded) here later in the New Kingdom, either in the 
        latter part of the reign of Amenhotpe III, or in that of his son Amenhotpe 
        IV better known as Akhenaten, that is in the mid 14<sup>th</sup> century 
        BC. Griffith's team excavated the well-preserved remains of a stone temple 
        (Temple A) built by, or possibly completed by, Tutankhamun.<br>

            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Temple A remained 
              in use for many centuries and inscriptions were found within it 
              of a number of later XIX<sup>th</sup> and XX<sup>th</sup> Dynasty 
              pharaohs including the most famous of them all, Ramesses II. The 
              latest attested Egyptian pharaoh at Kawa is Ramesses VI (1156 - 
              1149 BC). On the collapse of Egyptian control of the region, a process 
              completed by the earlier 11<sup>th</sup> century BC, the fate of 
              the town is unknown. It is next referred to on an inscription of 
              the early 7<sup>th</sup> century BC which however refers to the 
              earliest ruler of the Kingdom of Kush known to us by name, Alara 
              (early 8<sup>th</sup> century BC), and implies that there was probably 
              a functioning Temple of Amun there at that time. </font></p>

              of the Kushite kings, Taharqo, who is mentioned in the Bible, passed 
              through Kawa in 690 BC on his way to Egypt and was appalled at the 
              state of a temple there. He ordered the reconstruction of that building 
              and, in 684 BC, began the construction of a large temple to the 
              principal god of the Kushite pantheon, Amun (Temple T) which was 
              completed in four years by a team of architects and masons brought 
              from Memphis especially for the task (Plate 1). At that time Kush 
              was the only power in the Nile Valley, the rule of its king stretching 
              from Central Sudan to the Mediterranean. Kawa was a nome capital, 
              a regional capital, and held a prominent place in the ritualised 
              demonstration of royal power of the Kushite kings. A number of inscriptions, 
              including that of King Irike-Amanote (<i>c</i>. 431-405 BC) carved 
              on the walls of the Temple of Amun, record that the town was one 
              of several sites visited by the new Kushite monarchs. At each of 
              these the king's divine mandate to rule was confirmed by the local 
              god, here Amun of Gematon, depicted as a ram-headed god with the 
              horizontally twisted horns of the sheep species <i>ovis longipes 
              palaeoaegyptiaca</i>. </font></p>
