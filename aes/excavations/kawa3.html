              monuments have been recognised in the main cemetery and these include 
              tumuli, circular mounds of earth covered in pebbles or stone fragments 
              (Plate 17), mud-brick pyramids or mastaba, mastaba of irregular 
              blocks of stone, and possibly pyramids of dressed sandstone blocks. 
              Many different grave types have been recorded. The classic Kushite 
              grave type consists of a long stepped passage leading down into 
              the alluvium. At the end of the passage 3-4m below the surface an 
              `arch'-shaped doorway leads into a cave excavated in the alluvium. 
              The best preserved of these graves contained the burial of a female 
              placed on her back with the arms alongside the body. The body was 
              set on a wooden bed or bier, the legs of which were set in holes 
              in the ground. She wore copper-alloy rings on her toes and has a 
              scarab seal at the waist. Alongside the body were four large and 
              painted pottery vessels (Plate 18), a copper-alloy bowl and a copper-alloy 
              object which may be the handle perhaps of a mirror or fan. After 
              the deceased was placed in the tomb the doorway was blocked by a 
              wall of mud brick and the passageway was refilled with earth. The 
              tomb monument stood over the site of the tomb on the ground surface.</font></p>

            graves have been re-used on several occasions. For the second use 
            the bones of the original occupants were often unceremoniously pushed 
            to one side and the new burial placed in the centre of the tomb. Later 
            burials lay on earth which had already covered the previous burial. 
            After each reuse the doorway was again blocked and the passage way 
            refilled. Burials were also placed in simple long narrow pits, often 
            dug into the fill of the passageways of earlier tombs. The most unusual 
            grave of this type, dug into the top of a tumulus, contained all the 
            bones of an adult female and an adolescent neatly piled together at 
            one end of the long grave, the rest of the grave being empty. In another 
            grave there was an additional human skull and a few other bones, the 
            significance of which is unclear.</font></td>

              Nile at Kawa 2000 and more years ago. The proportion of the site 
              excavated today is very small yet we can begin to trace the history 
              of the town and to document the lifestyle of the inhabitants. The 
              general picture is one of affluence. The houses are well built, 
              there is abundant pottery and fine quality jewellery, and the general 
              health of the population looks to have been high. It is hoped that 
              further work will continue to amplify our knowledge of this major 
              ancient city in Northern Sudan. </font></p>
