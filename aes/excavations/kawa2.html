              British once again returned to Kawa, firstly to undertake a detailed 
              survey of the environs of the town and then, since 1997, to recommence 
              excavations in the town and its associated cemetery. Griffith and 
              his team had concentrated on what was clearly the main religious 
              centre of the town. In line with modern fashions in archaeology 
              the current project of the Sudan Archaeological Research Society, 
              has sought to answer questions concerning the everyday lives of 
              the population of the town, how they lived, what they ate and at 
              what age and why they died, whether they died after a healthy long 
              life or succumbed to disease or a violent death at an early age. 
              </font> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The first 
              step was to produce a detailed plan of the whole town which was 
              found to be at least twice as large as Griffith had thought. It 
              is over 1km in length and up to 400m wide and rises a maximum of 
              11m above the plain (Plate 3).</font></p>

              this mound is entirely man-made, it is a tell like the type famous 
              from excavations elsewhere in the Middle East. Little now protrudes 
              above the sand yet the richness of the town can be appreciated from 
              the vast quantities of pottery which litter the surface along with 
              beads, and metal and stone objects. The remains of buildings flush 
              with the surface are visible everywhere and as part of the current 
              project these are being planned. We simply brush a few centimetres 
              of sand from the surface and the walls with their well-laid mud 
              bricks are plain to see. Some of these buildings are of very large 
              size, one complex is over 85m in length and 56m wide. So far houses, 
              monumental buildings, temples and kilns have been located. Excavations 
              have concentrated in two areas of the town. One of these is among 
              a group of houses of which five and two adjacent streets have been 
              cleared (Plate 4). </font>

              well built but, like modern houses in the local village, have floors 
              of mud or sand and little in the way of internal furnishings. There 
              are a few mud bins and a number of cylindrical ceramic ovens (Plate 
              5). In some rooms fires were lit directly on the floor. The interior 
              of the buildings were kept quite clean during their use but the 
              rubbish was thrown out of the window and formed large piles in the 
              street. However, when rooms were abandoned they were also used as 
              rubbish dumps and contain a wealth of pottery, animal bone and floral 
              remains - a real treasure trove for the archaeologist. All the houses 
              investigated so far date to the earlier Kushite period, probably 
              to the 8<sup>th</sup> - 6<sup>th</sup> centuries BC.<br>
