      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#000066"><b>The 
        Napoleonic Expedition and the growth of collecting (1798-1836)<br>
        </b></font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> The event which significantly 
        stimulated the growth of the Egyptian collections was the invasion of 
        Egypt by the French, led by Napoleon Bonaparte, in 1798. This aggressive 
        campaign was designed to threaten the British regime in India, but it 
        was attended by a more laudable purpose. The French army was accompanied 
        by a group of scholars who were instructed to prepare a survey of Egypt, 
        including accounts of the geography of the country, its natural history, 
        antiquities and general customs. To this end an Institute was established 
        in Cairo to which were brought the various specimens collected by the 
        scholars; these included antiquities. The most notable antiquity, discovered 
        at Rosetta in 1799, was a stone inscribed with three bands of text, written 
        in different scripts, hieroglyphic, demotic and Greek. It was at once 
        recognised as offering a possible key to the deciphering of the ancient 
        Egyptian scripts, because the Greek text could be read. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">After the defeat of 
        the French in 1801, the Egyptian antiquities collected in Cairo were confiscated 
        by the British army in the name of King George III. When they were brought 
        back to Britain, they were presented to the British Museum, forming the 
        first important acquisition of large sculptures. There were granite statues, 
        seated and standing, of the lioness-deity Sekhmet from Thebes, and a huge 
        breccia royal sarcophagus, removed from a mosque in Alexandria where it 
        had been used as a public bath. At the time it vas thought to be the sarcophagus 
        of Alexander the Great, the Greek conqueror of Egypt in 332 BC, but when 
        the texts on it could be read, it turned out to belong to King Nectanebo 
        II of the Thirtieth Dynasty, who died a generation before Alexander's 
        conquest. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">But the most important 
        acquisition at this time was the Rosetta Stone. Although it took twenty 
        years for the first significant results in decipherment to emerge, the 
        stone was from the first recognised as of the greatest importance. When 
        the stone was exhibited in the British Museum, it established the primacy 
        of the Egyptian collections, and it has remained the best known Egyptian 
        antiquity in the Museum. It is not a work of art, but it is recognised 
        as the monument by which most of the reliable knowledge of ancient Egypt 
        has been gained. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Following the defeat 
        of the French, Egypt came under the control of Mohammed Ali Pasha, the 
        Turkish viceroy, but virtual ruler of the land. He opened up Egypt to 
        foreign diplomats, businessmen and tourists, and a scramble for antiquities 
        followed. As far as the British Museum was concerned its principal agent 
        for obtaining antiquities was Henry Salt, British Consul-General in Egypt. 
        In partnership with Jean-Louis Burckhardt, a Swiss scholar and traveller, 
        and with the practical help of Giovanni-Battista Belzoni, he arranged 
        for the removal of a great bust of King Ramses II from his mortuary temple, 
        the Ramesseum, in Western Thebes, and for its presentation to the British 
        Museum in 1817. It was the first masterpiece of Egyptian sculpture to 
        enter the collections, and it still occupies a prime position in the Egyptian 
        Sculpture Gallery. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The gift of this huge 
        sculpture was received with enthusiasm by the Museum's Trustees and the 
        British public, and Henry Salt was encouraged to undertake the regular 
        collection of Egyptian objects for the Museum. Belzoni as Salt's agent, 
        working with official permissions, began a campaign of excavation and 
        collecting mostly in the Theban area. The science of excavation was not 
        yet evolved, but Belzoni showed a natural talent for field-work, developing 
        a sympathetic interest in ancient Egypt and its physical remains. He was 
        instrumental in sending to London many fine sculptures, some taken from 
        the vast temple-complex of Karnak, and others from the mortuary temple 
        of King Amenhotep III in Western Thebes.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Belzoni also worked 
        in the royal and nobles tombs in Western Thebes, and built up for Salt 
        a large collection of smaller objects: tomb painting, papyri, small sculpture, 
        wooden tomb figures, and items of domestic furniture and household equipment. 
        Much of this additional material also came to the British Museum from 
        Henry Salt, providing the foundation of the rich collection of funerary 
        equipment and of objects illustrating the daily life of the ancient Egyptians. 
        Unfortunately, a dispute between Henry Salt and the Trustees of the Museum 
        resulted in a large part of Salt's collection going to Paris.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> By the middle of 
        the 1820s British travellers in Egypt brought back to Britain large quantities 
        of antiquities, and in due course many important pieces were presented 
        to the Museum. Purchases were also made at the many sales of antiquities 
        which occurred with increasing frequency during the first half of the 
        nineteenth century. In particular, many fine papyri and small objects 
        were bought in 1835 at the sale of the remnants of Henry Salt's collection 
        (he himself had died in 1827). In 1833 papyri and funerary inscriptions 
        in quantity were bought at the sale of John Barker, Salt's successor as 
        Consul-General in Egypt; in 1834 the collection of Joseph Sams was acquired; 
        in 1836 purchases were made at the James Burton sale and at the first 
        of two sales of Salt's second agent Giovanni d'Athanasi (the second followed 
        in 1837). Very important literary papyri were bought in 1839 at the sale 
        of the huge collection amassed by an Armenian merchant in Alexandria, 
        generally known as Giovanni Anastasi. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">From the time of the 
        foundation of Museum, the Egyptian objects were part of the general Department 
        of Antiquities, and there was no Egyptological specialist to supervise 
        or promote them. Yet during the 1830s many thousands of small objects 
        swelled the Egyptian collections, and also many larger pieces: two monumental 
        lions, given in 1835 by Lord Prudhoe who had brought them to Britain from 
        Gebel Barkal in the Sudan. They had originally been set up in the temple 
        of King Amenhotep III at Soleb, also in the Sudan; one bears the name 
        of King Tutankhamun. In 1837, the Museum purchased a very important list 
        of Egyptian kings which came from the temple of King Ramses II at Abydos.</font></p>
