        <b><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#CC0000">The 
        'Unlucky Mummy'</font></b></h4>
      <h4><b><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#000066">What 
        is it?</font></b></h4>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> The 'Unlucky Mummy' 
        is not a mummy at all, but rather a gessoed and painted wooden 'mummy-board' 
        or inner coffin lid (height 162 cm), numbered EA 22542. It was found at 
        Thebes and can be dated by its shape and the style of its decoration to 
        the late 21st or early 22nd Dynasty (c 950-900 BC). </font>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> The beardless face 
        and the position of the hands with fingers extended show that it was made 
        to cover the mummy of a woman. Her identity is not known: the brief hieroglyphic 
        inscriptions contain only short religious phrases, and omit mention of 
        the name of the deceased. The high quality of the lid indicates that the 
        owner was a person of high rank. It was usual for such ladies to participate 
        in the musical accompaniments to the rituals in the temple of Amen-Ra; 
        hence early British Museum publications described the owner of 22542 as 
        a 'priestess of Amen-Ra'. E A Wallis Budge, Keeper of Egyptian and Assyrian 
        Antiquities from 1894 to 1924, also suggested that she might have been 
        of royal blood, but this was pure speculation and is not supported by 
        the iconography of the lid. </font>
      <h4> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b><font color="#000066">History 
        of EA 22542</font></b></font></h4>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> The mummy-board was 
        presented to the British Museum in July 1889 by Mrs Warwick Hunt of Holland 
        Park, London, on behalf of Mr Arthur F Wheeler. It was displayed in the 
        'First Egyptian Room' of the Museum as early as 1890 and has remained 
        on public view ever since, with the exception of periods during the First 
        and Second World Wars, when it was removed from its case for safety. It 
        has left the Museum only once, in 1990, when it formed part of a temporary 
        exhibition held at two venues in Australia. It is currently displayed 
        in Room 62. The mummy to which EA 22542 belonged is said to have been 
        left in Egypt; it never formed part of the collections of the British 
        Museum. </font>
      <h4> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b><font color="#000066">The 
        'Unlucky Mummy' in folklore</font></b></font></h4>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> The mummy-board has 
        acquired a reputation for bringing misfortune, and a vast web of mythology 
        has developed around it. It has been credited with causing death, injury 
        and large-scale disasters such as the sinking of the Titanic in 1912. 
        None of these stories has any basis in fact, but from time to time the 
        strength of the rumours has led to a flood of enquiries on the subject. 
        A disclaimer written by Wallis Budge was published in 1934, and yet since 
        that time the myth has undergone further embellishment. The main elements 
        of the story are as follows. </font>
      <h4> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b><font color="#000066">A 
        'curse' on the owners</font></b></font></h4>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> The mummy-board is 
        said to have been bought by one of four young English travellers during 
        a holiday in Egypt at some time during the 1860s or 1870s. Shortly afterwards 
        one of these men suffered a gunshot wound which deprived him of the use 
        of his right arm. A second died in another shooting incident. The third 
        and fourth both died in poverty within a short time. The mummy-board was 
        passed to the sister of one of the travellers, but as soon as it had entered 
        the house the occupants suffered a series of misfortunes. The celebrated 
        clairvoyant Madame Helena Blavatsky, while visiting the house, is alleged 
        to have detected an evil influence, which was ultimately traced to the 
        mummy-board. She urged the owner to dispose of it and in consequence it 
        was presented to the British Museum. The carrier who transported the lid 
        to the museum died within a week and even a man who had helped to carry 
        the case into the building suffered a serious accident. These incidents 
        were attributed to the malign spirit of the 'priestess' who had been buried 
        with the mummy-board. </font>
      <h4> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b><font color="#000066">Photographic 
        peculiarities</font></b></font></h4>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> The lid had been 
        photographed before being given to the British Museum. When the negative 
        was developed it was said to have revealed in place of the painted mask 
        'the face of a living Egyptian woman of malevolent aspect'. The photographer 
        committed suicide within the year. In or about 1904 the photographer Mansell 
        was commissioned to photograph the lid again. Returning after a visit 
        to the museum to make preparations, Mansell's son injured his thumb during 
        the railway journey, and the photographer reached home to find that one 
        of his children had suffered a dangerous accident. While photographing 
        EA 22542 the following day the same photographer injured his face on a 
        glass display case and damaged a piece of photographic apparatus. </font>
      <h4> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b><font color="#000066">A 
        'soul in torment'</font></b></font></h4>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Among those who took 
        a special interest in the 'Unlucky Mummy' were Thomas Douglas Murray (died 
        1911) and the journalist W T Stead. Murray, an amateur Egyptologist and 
        associate of the excavator Flinders Petrie, is reported to have been instrumental 
        in having the lid presented to the British Museum. Stead was among the 
        first to publish the story of its supposed malign influence. Both men 
        were interested in the paranormal, and 'decided that the expression on 
        the face [of the lid] was that of a living soul in torment'. As recounted 
        by Budge, 'They wished to hold a seance in a room and to perform certain 
        experiments with the object of removing the anguish and misery from the 
        eyes of the coffin-lid.' The publication of their views resulted in donations 
        of money from Algeria and New Zealand to pay for floral offerings to be 
        laid before the lid. 'Sad to say', recalls Budge, 'I believe that the 
        money offerings were absorbed by the hard hearted Treasurer of the Museum, 
        and no flowers were bought.' </font>
      <h4> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b><font color="#000066">Removal 
        to the basements</font></b></font></h4>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> By 1908-9 the lid 
        had gained a nationwide reputation for causing unexplained mishaps. It 
        was now also believed to emit strange sounds in the night. The terrified 
        security staff of the museum, it was alleged, refused to approach it and 
        demanded that it be removed from the public galleries. It was therefore, 
        according to the story, removed from display and stored in the museum's 
        basements. An exact replica was made and displayed in place of the original, 
        until an American visitor noticing this, threatened the museum with public 
        humiliation for exhibiting a 'fake'. </font>
      <h4> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b><font color="#000066">The 
        Titanic</font></b></font></h4>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Once satisfied of 
        the reason for the substitution, the American offered to buy the original 
        lid for a museum in the USA. The offer was accepted by the authorities 
        of the British Museum, and the purchaser shipped the lid on the Titanic 
        on its maiden voyage in 1912. The presence of such an ill-omened object 
        on board caused the ship to collide with an iceberg and sink. The lid, 
        however, survived this disaster: according to one version of the story, 
        the wealthy owner succeeded by bribery in having the piece brought safely 
        to the USA; an alternative account states that the wooden crate containing 
        the lid was salvaged after the disaster. Such was the notoriety of 22542 
        that the story of its supposed association with the Titanic was in circulation 
        within months of the disaster - yet at no point in the interim had it 
        left the British Museum. A possible explanation for the association of 
        22542 with the Titanic lies in the fact that W T Stead was among those 
        who died when the ship sank and, according to one of the survivors, told 
        the story of the British Museum's 'unlucky mummy case' to fellow passengers 
        during the voyage. </font>
      <h4> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b><font color="#000066">Further 
        exploits</font></b></font></h4>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Following its alleged 
        arrival in the USA the lid is supposed to have continued to bring misfortune. 
        Its American owner sold it to a Canadian, who took it to Montreal. 'Even 
        there (recounts Budge) it continued its evil course, and when finally 
        its owner decided to send it back to England, it sunk when the Empress 
        of Ireland went down in the St Lawrence River'. </font>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> The Egyptologist 
        Margaret Murray claimed in her autobiography (1963) that she had concocted 
        this part of the story, apparently as a badly-timed joke. By this time, 
        however, the myth was spreading without assistance. Owing to its reputation, 
        the mummy-board came to be suspected of causing disasters of even greater 
        magnitude; hence reverses suffered by British forces during the First 
        World War were also attributed to the malign influence of the 'priestess'. 
        </font>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> The stories outlined 
        here are a mixture of pure invention, unsubstantiated rumour and misunderstanding. 
        Although proof of the mummy-board's alleged supernatural powers is completely 
        lacking the mythology surrounding it has evolved over the past hundred 
        years and continues to acquire new dimensions.</font>
