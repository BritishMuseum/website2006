        <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b><font color="#CC0000">What 
        does the Rosetta Stone say?</font></b></font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Rosetta stone 
        is dated to March 196 BC, in the 9th year of Ptolemy V. The background 
        to the setting up of the stela was the confirmation of the control of 
        the Ptolemaic kings over Egypt. The Ptolemies were Greeks who had been 
        ruling Egypt since the fragmentation of the Empire of Alexander the Great, 
        and while they built temples in the Egyptian style, their lifestyle and 
        language remained exclusively Greek. Egypt had by now become a multi-cultural 
        society, a mixture of Greek and Egyptian, although in many parts of the 
        country the two rarely met.<br>
        <br>
        In the years preceding the setting up of the Rosetta Stone, control of 
        certain parts of Egypt had been lost to the family of the Ptolemies, and 
        it had taken the Ptolemaic armies some time to put down opposition in 
        the Delta; parts of southern Upper Egypt, particularly Thebes, were not 
        yet back in the control of the government. It appears that it was decided 
        that the best way to emphasise the legitimacy of the 13 year old Ptolemy 
        V in the eyes of the Egyptian elite was to re-emphasise his traditional 
        royal credentials with a coronation ceremony in the city of Memphis, and 
        to affirm his royal cult throughout Egypt. This second aim was done through 
        a series of priestly decrees, of which the Rosetta Stone is by far the 
        best-known example. It is a version of the decree issued at the city of 
        Memphis; other decrees include the Canopus decree in the Egyptian Museum 
        in Cairo.<br>
        <br>
        The inscription begins with praise of Ptolemy, and then includes an account 
        of the siege of the city of Lycopolis (a town in the Delta, not identified 
        with certainty), and the good deeds done by the king for the temples. 
        The final part of the text describes the decree's overriding purpose, 
        the establishment of the cult of the king. For example, it stipulates 
        how the priests shall maintain the cult of the king ('...the priests shall 
        pay homage three times a day...'), how the king's shrine is to be set 
        up ('...there shall be set upon the shrine the ten gold crowns of the 
        king...'), and days when certain festivals, such as the king's birthday, 
        shall be celebrated. It ends by saying that it is to be made known that 
        all the men of Egypt should magnify and honour Ptolemy V, and that the 
        text should be set up in hard stone in the three scripts which the Rosetta 
        Stone still bears today (hieroglyphic, Demotic, and Greek).<br>
        <br>
        In pre-Ptolemaic times, decrees in hieroglyphs such as this were usually 
        set up by the king, and it is an interesting indication of how far things 
        had changed from Pharaonic times that the priests, the only people still 
        with the knowledge of writing hieroglyphs, were now publishing such decrees. 
        The list of good deeds done by the king for the temples hints at the way 
        in which the support of the priests was ensured, and how the fusion of 
        Greek and Egyptian cultures was managed.</font></p>
