      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Note that the stock

      <h4><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b><font color="#000066">The 
        year</font></b> </font></h4>
      <h4><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><i>renpet</i> 'year', 
        <i>abed</i> 'month', <i>su</i> 'day' (in dates) (usual word for day is 
        '<i>heru</i>') </font></h4>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> The solar year (the 
        time it takes the earth to go around the sun) is 365.25 days. In the ancient 
        and medieval periods, the river Nile followed a natural annual cycle of 
        summer to autumn flood (fields covered by the river), winter to spring 
        season of sowing crops (fields emerge from the receding waters), and spring 
        to summer dry season (river at its lowest). The annual flood was heralded 
        in the skies by the day (in July) when for the first time in months the 
        star Sirius rose in advance of the sun at dawn. </font> 
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> The Egyptian words 
        for the three seasons were <i>akhet</i> 'flood', <i>peret</i> 'spring' 
        (literally 'emergence') and <i>shemu</i> 'drought'. The agricultural year 
        revolved around this Nile cycle, with an idle autumn during the flood, 
        a sowing season in late winter and spring, and the labour intensive harvest 
        season in early summer. </font>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Although the Nile 
        cycle was one of the most regular patterns in nature, the height of the 
        flood was never entirely predictable, depending on rains in the Ethiopian 
        highlands at the river sources. A low Nile brought famine, and an excessive 
        flood might wreak devastation, as in 1821 when the river swept away the 
        ruins of the Ptolemaic temple at Qau in Upper Egypt. </font>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> During the nineteenth 
        and twentieth centuries governments sought to control the river in order 
        to prevent the death and disease caused by low or high Niles; from the 
        1830s to the 1960s a series of dams and barrages were built, culminating 
        in the construction of the High Dam at Aswan. This control and the introduction 
        of cash crops in the early nineteenth century have changed the agricultural 
        base of Egyptian life; cotton, bananas, potatoes and other imports have 
        replaced the flax, barley and emmer wheat of ancient Egypt. </font>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> The civil or regnal 
        year (i.e. year of reign of the current king) consisted of 12 months of 
        thirty days each, with an addition of 5 days at the end of the year to 
        round it up in single days as near as possible to the solar year. </font>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> The missing quarter 
        day meant that the civil year slipped by one day every 4 years, and by 
        a full year every 365 x 4 years. This means that it is more difficult 
        for us to calculate specific dates in ancient texts; it does not mean 
        that the system functioned any less efficiently for its basic purpose 
        of measuring time across generations e.g. for legal and administrative 
        cases. </font>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Some festivals and 
        periods of temple observance did not need such long-term time-measuring; 
        therefore they used instead the shorter, dramatic lunar cycle, where the 
        moon visibly loses and gains its shape every 28 days. </font>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> This meant that in 
        effect three calendars were in operation: in addition to the monthly lunar 
        cycle, there was the 'natural' solar year determining the agricultural 
        cycle of flood, sowing-season and harvest, and the 'civil year' by which 
        most important occasions were fixed (e.g. the 'harvest festival' in month 
        9 of the civil year would, with the moving of the civil year of 365 days 
        against the natural solar year of 365.25 days, move gradually backwards 
        out of the harvest season into the flood season until 365x4 years brought 
        the cycle full circle again and it was celebrated again on the correct 
        day - this shows the religious power of the civil 'royal' year with its 
        precedence over the natural solar year). </font>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Civil years were 
        calculated from year 1 of the reigning king. This made it necessary to 
        keep king lists recording years, months and days of each reign: the only 
        surviving manuscript is the Turin King list, a fragmentary papyrus of 
        the 13th century BC, with kings from the beginning until (in the preserved 
        portion) 17th dynasty and the Hyksos 'foreign kings' of c. 1650-1550 BC. 
        </font>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Summarising king 
        lists were inscribed in stone for certain occasions: at Abydos in royal 
        cult temples of the 19th Dynasty (13th century BC) to commemorate the 
        full string of ancestral kings back to the god-king Osiris, and at Karnak 
        in a sanctuary of Thutmose III of the 18th Dynasty (c. 1450 BC) to record 
        apparently all kings whose statues were at the temple at that date (perhaps 
        specifically those kings whose cults were renewed at the time that their 
        statues had to be moved to make way for the grand new temple constructions 
        of Thutmose III). These monuments provided crucial materials to 19th century 
        Egyptologists in their first attempts to introduce order into the mass 
        of materials surviving from ancient Egypt, because the Abydos and Turin 
        King lists are in the same order and this proves to be the chronological 
        sequence of kings. </font>
