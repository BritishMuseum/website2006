      <h3><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><br>
        <font color="#CC0000">The Rosetta Stone</font></font></h3>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Rosetta Stone 
        is part of a granitoid stela, originally about six feet in height which 
        was set up in March, 196 BC. It is a copy of a decree passed by a general 
        council of priests which assembled at Memphis on the first anniversary 
        of the coronation of Ptolemy V Epiphanes, king of all Egypt. The text 
        concerns the honours bestowed on the king by temples of Egypt in return 
        for services rendered by him to Egypt both at home and abroad. Priestly 
        privileges, especially those of an economic nature, are listed in detail.<br>
        <br>
        The stone was discovered in 1799 when some French soldiers in Napoleon's 
        army were digging the foundations of an addition to a fort near the town 
        of Rashid (Rosetta) in the Nile delta. The stone was subsequently ceded 
        to the British government by the terms of the treaty of Alexandria in 
        1801 and has been exhibited in the British Museum since 1802.<br>
        <br>
        The immediate importance of the Rosetta Stone lay in the fact that the 
        Egyptian hieroglyphic text was accompanied by the Greek translation which 
        could be read. A third inscription on the stone was written in Demotic, 
        a cursive script developed late in Egyptian history and used in most cases 
        only for secular documents. Thus the stone displayed the same text in 
        three scripts, but only two languages, Egyptian and Greek.<br>
        <br>
        The Egyptians used the hieroglyphic script for nearly 3,500 years, beginning 
        in about 3300 BC until the end of the fourth century AD. At about the 
        start of the third century AD, the Egyptians began to write their languages 
        in a script composed of the Greek alphabet, to which were added seven 
        characters derived ultimately from hieroglyphs. In this form the language 
        came to be known as Coptic, a corruption of the Greek word for 'Egypt', 
        <i>Aiguptios</i>. Knowledge of how to read and write the hieroglyphic 
        script was probably lost soon after it had been superseded and no key 
        to its meaning was found until the discovery of the Rosetta Stone.<br>
        <br>
        The Greek inscription was used by scholars as the key to the decipherment 
        of the hieroglyphs in the first section. Thomas Young, the English Physicist, 
        was the first to prove that the elongated ovals or cartouches in the hieroglyphic 
        section of the stone contained a royal name written phonetically, in this 
        case that of Ptolemy. The French scholar J-F Champollion went on to correct 
        and enlarge Young's list of phonetic hieroglyphs and lay the foundations 
        of our knowledge of the ancient Egyptian language in a paper read to the 
        Académie des Inscriptions et Belles-lettres in Paris in 1822.</font></p>
