      <h3><font face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva" size="2"><br>
        <font color="#CC0000">What were the Pyramids for?</font></font> </h3>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva" size="2">Pyramids are tombs. Large 
        pyramids were used as royal tombs from about 2680 BC, when the first pyramid 
        was built at Saqqara for King Djoser of the Third Dynasty.<br>
        <br>
        This was a pyramid in six steps, and stepped pyramids continued to be 
        used until the beginning of the Fourth Dynasty in about 2600 BC.<br>
        <br>
        At the site of Meidum, about 90 km south of modern Cairo, is a pyramid 
        which was built (perhaps by Sneferu) as a stepped structure with six steps, 
        later enlarged to eight, and finally converted into a true pyramid with 
        straight sides.<br>
        <br>
        The first pyramid to be built from the outset in the true form is the 
        northern or 'red' pyramid of King Sneferu at Dahshur.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva" size="2">The pyramid remained the 
        standard form of royal tomb from its beginnings in 2680 BC to about 1550 
        BC, but the pyramids at the end of this long sequence were very much smaller 
        than the earlier ones. From the reign of King Senwosret II of the Twelfth 
        Dynasty (1880-1874 BC), pyramids were built of sun-dried mud bricks instead 
        of stone, although the exterior was still covered by a limestone casing.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva" size="2">Remains of over a hundred 
        royal pyramids have been found in Egypt, although the most famous examples 
        are those at the site of Giza near modern Cairo, where the largest pyramid 
        of all stands: that of King Khufu (about 2570 BC). This monument (The 
        Great Pyramid), and the nearby pyramids of Kings Khafre and Menkaure, 
        have attracted most attention owing to their large size, good state of 
        preservation, and ease of access from Cairo.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva" size="2">The pyramid is a solar 
        symbol, perhaps associated with the shape of the benben stone which was 
        at the centre of the solar cult at Heliopolis. The main aspect of the 
        afterlife of the king was that he passed into the realm of the sun-god, 
        and the shape of the pyramid perhaps stressed this.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva" size="2">Pyramids are not confined 
        to Egypt, as there are more than 200 of them in the Sudan, at the various 
        burial sites of the Kushite and Meroitic rulers. These pyramids are smaller 
        than most of their Egyptian counterparts, and have much steeper sides. 
        They show how Egyptian traditions were perpetuated for more than 1000 
        years after the last royal pyramid was built in Egypt.</font></p>
