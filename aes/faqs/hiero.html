      <h3><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><br>
        <font color="#CC0000">What are hieroglyphs?</font></font> </h3>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The <a href="rosetta.html">Rosetta 
        Stone</a>, the most famous object in the collections of the Department 
        of Egyptian Antiquities, was at the centre of the decipherment of the 
        ancient Egyptian languages. The stone stands near the end of the almost 
        four-thousand-year-long history of the hieroglyphic script, which was 
        first written around 3300 BC. Like any language, including English, the 
        ancient Egyptian language changed over centuries. The Rosetta Stone records 
        two stages of this language: an archaic formal language used for inscriptions, 
        and a more contemporary form called Demotic. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Hieroglyphs record 
        this language with a mixed system of sound signs and picture signs. The 
        sound signs record the consonants of the language, but not true vowels. 
        Occasionally, the versions of Egyptian words that are recorded in the 
        scripts of other cultures help us to reconstruct the missing sounds. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> The sound signs are 
        pictures that have acquired a sound value from the sound of the word for 
        the object they represent: thus a picture of a mouth, in Egyptian <i>ro</i>, 
        writes the letter <i>r</i>. Some signs write one letter, some two or three. 
        Other signs write whole words; picture signs placed at the end of most 
        words (called 'determinatives') help indicate the category of the word. 
        Although hieroglyphs can be read either from left to right or right to 
        left, the bird and animal signs almost always face the start of the line. 
        </font></p>
      <h4><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#000066">The 
        Egyptian Language</font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> 
        </font></h4>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Egyptian belongs 
        to the Afro-Asiatic language family, which spreads geographically over 
        northern Africa, the Eastern Mediterranean, and Western Asia. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Egyptian survived 
        as a spoken language until the fifteenth century An Two major stages of 
        the language can be identified: early Egyptian (down to 1300 BC), and 
        later Egyptian (down to the Middle Ages); later Egyptian comprises New 
        Egyptian, then Demotic, and finally Coptic, when the language was written 
        in a form of the Greek alphabet. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> All these stages 
        of the language are known only in writing, so that its development must 
        be traced at second hand. Spoken languages change continuously - differences 
        have developed between British and American English in the three and half 
        centuries since the New World was colonised, including pronunciation, 
        grammar and vocabulary - but writing is more conservative. It is impossible 
        to be sure how the written Egyptian language was related to the spoken 
        language in any period, but it is certain that by the end of the Old Kingdom 
        (about 2100 BC) the spoken and written languages had already diverged 
        widely. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> The change from early 
        to later Egyptian can be observed in a new phase of the language, New 
        Egyptian, which became the standard used for written records in the 1 
        9th Dynasty (about 1300 BC). However, some official texts continued to 
        be written in classical Middle Egyptian, a phase of early Egyptian. </font></p>
      <h3><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#000066">The 
        Classic Script </font></h3>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> From the earliest 
        times the Egyptian script was employed on on many different surfaces. 
        The most prestigious form of hieroglyphs from the Old Kingdom onwards 
        consisted of as carefully delineated, detailed pictorial representations; 
        these were executed as part of royal and courtly works, usually with royal 
        and religious content. In extreme cases, the full pictorial aspect was 
        given free rein, although such elaboration usually concerned detail rather 
        than the basic shape of a sign. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> The ideal was to 
        have each sign carved in relief, with its internal details incised, and 
        then painted or inlaid. Such an elaborate and slow method of production 
        meant that the signs themselves were a display of wealth and prestige 
        regardless of their meaning and the significance of the text that they 
        recorded. Hieroglyphs were also carved in sunk relief, often with incised 
        details, or simply carved as silhouettes and painted monochrome, producing 
        an effect similar to carved hieroglyphs that had been inlaid. Both the 
        forms of individual signs and spelling vary over time and with contexts, 
        as well as between groups of artists.</font></p>
