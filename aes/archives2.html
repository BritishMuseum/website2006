      <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva">An early source of information 
        on the collection which remains a frequently consulted and useful research 
        tool for the curators are the entries describing individual antiquities 
        made by Samuel Birch, Keeper of Oriental Antiquities from 1860. These 
        manuscript notes, known as the Birch slips, are now bound into numbered 
        volumes.</font></p>
      <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva"> The earliest records 
        of museum administration, and correspondence concerning Egyptian antiquities, 
        are held in the museum's Central Archives. Although the museum was founded 
        in 1753, a separate Department of Antiquities was not founded until 1807, 
        and it was not until 1860 that there was a three-way division of the Department 
        of Antiquities into a department for Greece and Rome, a department for 
        Coins and Medals, and the Oriental Department (comprising Egypt, Assyria, 
        British and Medieval Antiquities and Ethnography). In 1886, the Oriental 
        Department was renamed Egyptian and Assyrian Antiquities, and it was not 
        until 1955 that the department split into the Department of Egyptian Antiquities 
        (now renamed the Department of Ancient Egypt and Sudan) and the Department 
        of Western Asiatic Antiquities (now the Department of the Ancient Near 
        East). This rather complex history has meant that the Egyptian correspondence, 
        for a time, was bound yearly with the Western Asiatic material, and these 
        papers are now held in the library of the Ancient Near East Department. 
        The letters are arranged alphabetically within what are mainly single 
        volumes for each year from 1826.</font></p>
      <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva"> The rest of the archival 
        material is amazingly diverse, defying neat classification. It includes 
        the personal papers and diaries of former keepers, curators and excavators, 
        early nineteenth-century photographs and heavy wooden boxes of glass negatives, 
        early drawings and watercolours, and an important set of 'squeezes', made 
        by J.G. Wilkinson. These were impressions, on specially treated paper, 
        of ancient reliefs and inscriptions. There are also early x-rays of various 
        mummies, and memorabilia from the museum's blockbuster Tutankhamun Exhibition 
        held in 1972, when long queues of visitors stretched around the block. 
        The museum keeps records of its displays and exhibitions, and the original 
        artwork for its catalogues. All the museum's records are part of the public 
        records of the nation and thus come under strict regulations for their 
        preservation.</font></p>
