          as much as any other ancient object, and need to be understood as such,

          Egyptian language evolved over 3000 years, as Egyptian society changed. 
          Like any language, written Egyptian was different from spoken Egyptian, 
          and changed more slowly. Different forms of the language and styles of 
          script were used for different purposes. In the Christian Period, Egyptian 
          began to be written in a version of the Greek alphabet called Coptic.

              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#000000"> 
                Hieroglyphs record this language (which belongs to the AfroAsiatic 
                family) with a mixed system of sound signs and picture signs. The 
                sound signs record the consonants of the language, but not true 
                vowels. Occasionally, the versions of Egyptian words that are recorded 
                in the scripts of other cultures help us reconstruct the missing 
                sounds. </font> 
              <p> 
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#000000"> 
                The sound signs are pictures which have acquired a sound-value from 
                the word for the object they represent: thus a picture of a mouth, 
                in Egyptian <i>ro</i>, writes the letter <i>r</i>. Some signs write 
                one letter, some two or three. Some signs write whole words; picture 
                signs placed at the end of most words (called `determinatives') 
                help indicate the category of words. Although hieroglyphs can be 
                read either from left to right or right to left, the bird and animal 
                signs almost always face the start of the line. </font> 
              <p> 
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#000000">The 
                word for `cat' has the letters <i>miw</i>. Egyptologists pronounce 
                the written letters as miew, but the word survives in Coptic, when 
                the vowels are written as emou; this suggests that actual sound 
                of the word was probably something like imayu. The word is written 
                with sound signs <i>mi</i> +<i> i</i> (a complement clarifying the 
                reading of the first sign) + <i>w</i>, followed by a picture (the 
                `determinative' sign) showing a cat. </font> 
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#000000">A 
                hieroglyph showing a cow's ear is used to write the word for `hear' 
                <i>s</i><cite><u>d</u></cite><i>m</i>. A sound sign for <i>m</i> 
                (an owl) follows to show how to read the sign. The pictures of, 
                and signs for, hearing are similar but are distinct. In scenes, 
                the idea of hearing is shown with an image of a human ear; in one 
                stela human ears are shown to represent the hearing of a god, while 
                a prayer for him to `hear' is written with the cow's ear. Kings 
                who were meant to listen to the concerns of their subjects were 
                represented in statues with unnaturally large ears. </font>

            <td colspan="3" height="674"> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#000000">From 
              earliest times the Egyptian script was employed on a wide variety 
              of surfaces. The most prestigious form of hieroglyphs from the Old 
              Kingdom onwards was as carefully delineated, detailed pictorial representations; 
              these were executed as part of royal and courtly works, usually with 
              royal and religious content. In extreme cases, the full pictorial 
              aspect was given free rein, although such elaboration generally concerned 
              detail rather than the basic shape of a sign. </font> 
              <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#000000">The 
                ideal was to have each sign carved in relief, with its internal 
                details incised, and then painted or inlaid. Such an elaborate and 
                slow method of production meant that the signs themselves were a 
                display of wealth and prestige, regardless of their meaning and 
                the significance of the text they recorded. Hieroglyphs were also 
                carved in sunk relief, often with incised details, or simply carved 
                as silhouettes and painted monochrome, producing a similar effect 
                to carved hieroglyphs that had been inlaid. Both the forms of individual 
                signs and spelling vary over time and with contexts, but also between 
              groups of artists. </font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#000000">Cursive 
                (joined up) versions of hieroglyphs, written with ink and a reed 
                pen, are first attested in the 0th Dynasty (c. 3500 BC). For the 
                Old Kingdom and later, the normal cursive form of the script that 
                evolved out of early writing with ink is termed `hieratic', from 
                the Greek word for `priestly', since it was later used in the Greco-Roman 
              Period only by priests.</font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#000000">The 
                style of script depends on the date and the type of a manuscript. 
                The forms of script embody and run parallel to a hierarchy of writing 
                uses. By the mid-Middle Kingdom hieratic had developed into two 
                varieties, formal and administrative. A less joined up form was 
                also retained (now known as `linear hieroglyphs') as a careful `book-hand' 
              for temple and funerary manuscripts. </font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#000000">In 
                hieratic, the pictorial aspect of the script is considerably reduced. 
                There is a tendency to write words out more fully, with more phonetic 
                signs. The cursive script was the normal medium for reading and 
              writing for everyday purposes.</font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#000000">The 
                Demotic script is a more cursive development of the hieratic script. 
                It is recognised as a separate script from the middle of the reign 
                of Psammetichus I (664--610 BC), and by 525 BC it was the standard 
                script for business and legal affairs throughout the country; hieratic 
                was retained for writing religious texts. The word `demotic' was 
                used by the Greeks to describe the everyday language of the Egyptians 
                from the seventh century BC (Greek <i>demos</i>, `the people'). 
                By the second half of the second century AD, however, demotic had 
              also become a learned script. </font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#000000">The 
                first significant attempts to write the Egyptian language with Greek 
                letters date from the second century AD. Inevitably an alphabet 
                that had evolved for the Greek language needed some adaptation for 
                writing Egyptian, and several letters were added, derived from demotic 
              signs. Many Greek words were also imported into the language. </font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#000000"> 
                By the mid fourth century, Coptic was used for literary works and 
                private letters. Arab dominance eventually caused Coptic to die 
                out as a spoken language by the fifteenth century, but it survived 
                as a liturgical language.</font>

                technical treatises, funerary and cult texts, letters, and entertainment 
                literature. Each sort of text had a particular style of language, 
                and also required a different code of conventions for interpretation: 
              each type of text has to be read in the right way.</font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#000000"> 
                The masterpiece of Egyptian writing, <i>The Tale of Sinuhe</i> is 
                a fictional poem, like <i>Paradise Lost</i>, and is not a work of 
                history, as Egyptologists used to think. Modern readers lack the 
                key to the cultural code, and can often misunderstand: all reading 
                and interpretation is an appropriation of the original meaning by 
                the reader. Understanding texts without knowing their living context 
                is difficult, like hearing cricket commentary without seeing play 
              and without knowing the rules of the game.</font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#000000">Although 
                writing was important in Egypt, and has been well preserved thanks 
                to the Egyptian climate, it only described certain aspects of life: 
                much was not written about in certain contexts. For example, sexuality 
                and private religious activity rarely features in texts. All records 
                were made by the upper classes, so only their view of the world 
                is preserved in words. Also, only texts from certain contexts, mostly 
                funerary ones, survive. The texts are part of the material remains 
                of ancient culture, and their silences can only by filled by archaeology 
                or by comparative studies. Writing preserved information to do with 
                practical concerns, but it was not simply a record of spoken messages. 
                Texts placed on statues and high up stone walls were written in 
                hieroglyphs - a script few people could read - and were often placed 
                in inaccessible places. Inscriptions such as these were not publications 
                meant to be read by everyone, but were a means of commemorating 
                events for eternity. One complete monument from Sinai was discovered 
                by Flinders Petrie on a hillside at Serabit el-Khadim in Sinai. 
                A rough wall of stone surrounded a stela and altar erected by two 
                officials on a mining expedition for the king. Although the stela 
                is modelled on funerary inscriptions, this monument was not their 
                tomb, but was intended to associate them with the cult of the nearby 
              temple of Hathor, Lady of Turquoise.</font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#000000">A 
                strange script is known mainly from a small number of votive offerings 
                and inscriptions at this site, including a sphinx with inscriptions 
                in both the Egyptian hieroglyphic and Proto-Sinaitic scripts. The 
                signs are modelled on Egyptian hieroglyphs, but derive their sound-values 
                from Semitic words. It has been claimed that the ghosts of the hieroglyphs 
                live on in our own roman alphabet, since this script may have influenced 
                the Semitic scripts, including Phoenician, which was later adopted 
                by the Greeks. The Greek alphabet indirectly inspired the Latin 
                alphabet, which has been adapted to write the majority of the world's 
              languages.</font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#000066"></font></p>

              </font></b><font color="#000000">Many aspects of culture are not attested 
              in surviving writings, and things like humour were not prominent in 
              official records, though some humorous papyri survive. Much of life 
              remained unwritten, and differences between modern and ancient Egyptian 
              ideas of what could be written or represented are immediately apparent. 
              For example, explicitly sexual motifs had a relatively limited role 
              in formal art and literature, apart from coded images or metaphors, 
              although direct representations and references to the gods' sexual 
              acts and potency occur in sacred contexts. Sexual activity between 
              humans is only represented directly on less formal artifacts, such 
              as sketches on spare flakes of limestone (`ostraca'). Funerary and 
              religious offerings to do with sexuality are often uninscribed and 
              can thus be difficult to interpret: for example, fertility figurines 
              placed in tombs have often been wrongly assumed to be children's toys.

              status of literacy was very high, and writing ability was essential 
              to attain rank as an official. The social prestige of writers and 
              copyists, called scribes, was consequently high. Probably less than 
              one percent of the population was literate, and thus writers formed 
              the elite of society. Very few women were literate. </font> 
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#000000"> 
                Writing was part of governing the country. Scribes also formed a 
                group of civil servants and bureaucrats carrying out the government 
                of the king and his high officials. Scribes are often shown in official 
                works of art, including models of scribes reckoning the goods of 
                the wealthy dead and scenes of them at work on tomb walls. Scribal 
                equipment was often placed in tombs as a status-symbol and a sign 
              of the tomb-owner's literacy/ability to read and write. </font></p>

                Statues placed in temples and tombs sometimes show high officials 
                in the characteristic cross-legged scribal posture and in the act 
                of reading and writing. Although writing ability was necessary to 
                be an official, these officials were much higher than simple scribes, 
                and the image of them is not realistic; instead it may show them 
                acting as a trusted scribe to the gods.</font> 
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#000000">The 
                scribes' equipment was a tool-kit, the original form of which was 
                shown in the sign used to write words for writing; it comprised 
                a bag or pot, ink wells and a pen-holder for pens. Later these were 
                combined into a single box, the scribal palette. The main writing 
                surface was papyrus (made from the reed-like papyrus plant), but 
                leather, wood and sometimes metal and stone were also used. Scribes 
                wrote in hieratic for day to day purposes, and hieroglyphs were 
                a more specialised ability: we can still see spelling mistakes and 
                slips, especially when the scribe was copying a text from hieratic 
                to hieroglyphs. </font>

                Many texts, artefacts and buildings from the village are preserved, 
                especially from the huge artificial pit used as a rubbish dump: 
                these give us an impression of the life of this, slightly untypical, 
                village, and occasionally reveal something of the personalities 
                of the ancient inhabitants. A few individual scribes are well known, 
                with their recognisable handwriting, tastes in history, styles of

                behaving badly towards his subordinates; his own letters sound confident 
                and self-assertive. He was a man of considerable learning, with 
                an interest in historical matters, who accumulated a considerable 
                library of papyri that has survived and was discovered among the
