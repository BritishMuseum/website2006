            <p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Sidon was an 
              important Phoenician harbour and one of the major sites in the ancient 
              world. It is situated about 20km south of Beirut. During the 19th 
              and early 20th century an important cemetery with stone coffins 
              and a temple dedicated to the god Eshmun were found on the outskirts 
              of Sidon, but relatively little was known about the city centre.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In the 1960s 
              three substantial sites were acquired by the Lebanese Directorate 
              General of Antiquities. Excavations at one of these, the 'College 
              Site', sponsored by the British Museum and directed by Claude Doumet-Serhal, 
              began in 1998. This is a joint project with the Lebanese Department 
              of Antiquities.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Early Bronze 
              Age is represented by a series of mud-brick walls associated with 
              plaster floors and various installations, and the finds include 
              pottery and fifteen cylinder seal impressions. In the most recent 
              season (2001), nineteen graves of the Middle Bronze Age (c.2000-1500 
              BC) have been discovered containing skeletons and a rich collection 
              of grave-goods. Some of the bodies were laid in graves lined with 
              stones, while other bodies, probably of babies or small children, 
              were placed in large jars. Most of the bodies were accompanies by 
              a collection of pottery vessels, sometimes with the addition of 
              bronze weapons and tools. These have included axes and spearheads. 
              In three of the graves were Egyptian scarabs, which will help the 
              graves to be accurately dated.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Nearly all the 
              graves were cut into a layer of sand up to 1.25m thick that covered 
              the remains of the Early Bronze Age (c.3500-2000 BC). This sand 
              was deliberately brought to the site by the early inhabitants of 
              Sidon, perhaps for religious reasons. In another area, large quantities 
              of Mycenaean and Iron Age pottery have been discovered.</font>
