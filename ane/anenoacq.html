          curators and other scholars helps a continuing reassessment and reinterpretation 
          of the collections. The growth of the collections through judicious 
          acquisition is a crucial element in this process. This includes groups 
          of material acquired from excavations as well as individual objects 
          varying from the everyday to the spectacular. Particular care is paid 
          to ensuring that these have secure provenances.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The most important 
          new acquisitions are placed on exhibition wherever possible; the others 
          maintain significance as part of the study collection. This particularly 
          applies to groups of pottery and other archaeological material excavated 
          by or on behalf of the Museum in those countries that permit export. 
          Such reference collections are often the most accessible of their type 
          to be held in perpetuity. Important acquisitions made over the past 
          decade are highlighted on the following pages.</font></p>

          Contemporary written sources, depictions in ancient art, excavated discoveries 
          and chance finds illustrate the richness of court life in the Persian 
          Empire. One of the most abundant surviving categories is that of Achaemenid 
          silver, found in graves and hoards across the Empire. The British Museum 
          has one of the finest collections of Achaemenid metalwork, ranging from 
          the <a href=compass/ixbin/goto?id=ENC6821 target="_blank">Oxus
          Treasure </a> to over a dozen silver vessels. One of these, acquired 
          in 1994, is one of four identical silver bowls inscribed with the name 
          and titles of the Persian king Artaxerxes I (465-425 BC). The companion 
          vessels are in the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the Freer Gallery of 
          Art in Washington and the Reza Abbasi collection in Tehran. They are 
          said to have been found together during the early 1930s at the ancient 
          city-site of Ecbatana (modern Hamadan) in western Iran. The bowl is 
          decorated with a stylized pattern of alternating lotus buds and petals 
          radiating from the centre of the bowl. This type of decoration is also 
          found on uninscribed silver and bronze bowls dating between the 6th 
          and 4th centuries BC. Analysis within the British Museum's Department 
          of Scientific Research indicates that it was hammered from a single 
          piece of very pure silver; the high silver value helps explain why this 
          fine bowl had been treasured in antiquity.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The bowl was purchased 
          with the assistance of the National Art Collections Fund, The British 
          Museum Friends and the Friends of the Ancient Near East. For more information

          fragment of a large stone relief is one of the most famous examples 
          of Late Assyrian art. It dates from the reign of King Ashurbanipal (668-627 
          BC) and was discovered during the 1850s in his palace at Nineveh. This 
          building, the so-called North Palace, was discovered by Hormuzd Rassam 
          who excavated it on behalf of the Trustees of the British Museum from 
          1853-54. During the subsequent year excavations were resumed by William 
          Kennet Loftus, assisted by the artist William Boutcher, who made a series 
          of very fine drawings of the reliefs. These included a series of fragmentary 
          reliefs in Room S that showed a royal lion hunt and which had apparently 
          fallen from an upper storey. Other more intact scenes showing similar 
          lion hunts survived on the lower storey of the palace. Boutcher's drawing 
          of this particular relief was published, as was an early photograph 
          of the piece, but the whereabouts and even the size of this sculpture 
          remained uncertain until William Boutcher's granddaughter, Miss Lilian 
          Boutcher, generously presented the sculpture to the Museum in 1992.

          Rome's relations with its eastern neighbours veered from costly wars 
          to regulated trade. One account, known as <i>The Periplus of the Erythraean 
          Sea</i> and probably dating from the 1st century AD, describes in detail 
          the ports and traded commodities of the Red Sea, Indian Ocean and Persian 
          Gulf. Archaeological surveys and excavations have added valuable information 
          about some of these sites and confirm the existence of a flourishing 
          maritime trade during this period. The island of Bahrain - then known 
          as Tylos - was a particularly important partner in the Gulf trade. Excavated 
          burial mounds provide evidence for blue-glazed jars and flasks imported 
          from Mesopotamia as well as occasional glass containers.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">This ribbed glass 
          bowl belongs to a Roman type known as a pillar-moulded bowl. It was 
          excavated by Captain Higham in Grave 36 at Shakhoura, near the village 
          of the same name in the northern part of Bahrain. Although other glass 
          bowls of this shape have been excavated in the Gulf, Mesopotamia and 
          as far east as Afghanistan, these are usually plain blue in colour, 
          whereas the beautiful marbled effect on this bowl was presumably intended 
          to imitate a more valuable semi-precious stone.<b><font size="3" color="#CC6600"><a name="new"></a></font></b></font></p>

          This clay document is an important addition to the Department's holding 
          of cuneiform tablets and of great importance for the history of religion 
          in the Ancient Near East. There had always been many gods in ancient 
          Mesopotamia. Theologians tried at various times to order things neatly, 
          producing lists of gods arranged in households, where each had his or 
          her own resposibility. During the first millennium BC some religious 
          thinkers proposed that there might be a single all-powerful deity, usually 
          the god Marduk. They got round the problem of 'rival' gods by explaining 
          them as merely an aspect of Marduk himself. This tablet contains part 
          of a long hymn praising Marduk in these terms.<b><font size="3" color="#CC6600"><a name="com"></a></font></b></font></p>

          Kings in Mesopotamia have bequeathed us many royal inscriptions, from 
          which modern scholars can sometimes reconstruct history. This bronze 
          vessel carries an inscription of a king called Utu-hegal, who ruled 
          from the city of Uruk in southern Iraq in about 2123-2113 BC. The inscription 
          gives us his name and titles, but nothing more than a curse formula 
          to prevent anyone from removing the vessel unlawfully. Perhaps the vessel 
          was held in the hands of a statue of the king. In later times Utu-hegal 
          was revered as the hero who removed the hated Guti invaders from the 
          land, but this vase is the only known inscription dating to the king's 
          reign.</font></p>
