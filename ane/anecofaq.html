          Where were the Hanging Gardens of Babylon? </font></b></font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><br>
          These gardens were described by classical authors as one of the Seven 
          Wonders of the Ancient World, but their location and even existence 
          is uncertain. This is largely because there are no contemporary descriptions 
          of them and the reliability of later authors is therefore questionable. 
          Moreover, classical authors frequently confused Babylon and Nineveh. 
          King Sennacherib described in detailed inscriptions how he diverted 
          several mountain streams to bring water via an aqueduct into his garden 
          at Nineveh, raising it to the top of the garden by means of devices 
          cast in bronze, and building artificial hills upon stone vaults. It 
          was declared a wonder for all peoples, and may be the origin of the 
          legend of the Hanging Gardens of Babylon.<a name="ark"></a><br>

          was the Ark of the Covenant?</font></b><br>
          The Ark was said to be a box made of acacia wood and entirely plated 
          with gold. It was intended as a container for the two stone tablets 
          bearing the terms of God's covenant with Israel given to Moses at Mount 
          Sinai. Biblical texts set the creation of the Ark in the period of Israel's 
          Exodus from Egypt when Israel had no permanent temple, so where in other 
          cultures covenant or treaty documents were kept for safety in shrines 
          here Israel needed a more portable box. It was viewed as God's footstool 
          where he was enthroned; it was the place where he appeared and consequently 
          became a symbol of his presence. Once Israel was established in Canaan, 
          the Ark was based at Shiloh and, after being captured by the Philistines 
          and returned, was eventually taken by David to Jerusalem where Solomon 
          placed it in his temple. It was probably destroyed when the forces of 
          Nebuchadnezzar II sacked the temple, but legends assert that it was 
          hidden in Mount Nebo in Jordan, in a cave beneath Jerusalem, or was 
          taken much earlier to Ethiopia. <a name="babel"></a></font></p>

          <b>What was the Tower of Babel?</b></font><br>
          This was described in the Old Testament as a structure erected by Noah's 
          descendants, some time after the deluge, in Babylonia. According to 
          Genesis, the Babylonians wanted to make a name for themselves by building 
          a mighty city and a tower 'with its top in the heavens'. God punished 
          them for their pride by confusing their language so that they could 
          not understand each other and scattering them across the earth.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">There are archaeological 
          indications that this tower did exist. Babylon was certainly an important 
          city and a ziggurat honouring the god Marduk was built, destroyed and 
          rebuilt until it was most likely the tallest structure in the region. 
          The tower's most splendid incarnation was probably under Nebuchadnezzar 
          II (604-562 BC), who rebuilt the tower to stand some 90 metres high. 
          Archaeologists examining the remains of the city of Babylon have found 
          what appears to be the foundation of the tower. Modern scholars, however, 
          are divided as to whether the Old Testament account refers to a real 
          tower or whether the story is purely theological.<a name="solomon"></a></font></p>

          <br>
          Solomon, who reigned during the tenth century BC, embarked on a vast 
          and expensive building programme within his kingdom. He was especially 
          lavish in his capital, Jerusalem, where among many magnificent new buildings 
          he constructed his famous Temple. The concentration of religious ritual 
          at the Temple made Jerusalem a place of pilgrimage and an important 
          cultural centre. No archaeological evidence has been found of the Temple, 
          as it is buried beneath a later platform, but the Bible does provide 
          us with detailed descriptions and measurements. We can also assume that 
          the architectural style of the Temple was similar to that of other buildings 
          in the region during the same period of the early Iron Age, with a long 
          sanctuary entered from one end through a columned portico flanked by 
          the columns named Jachin and Boaz. <a name="battery"></a></font></p>

          <b>Is the Baghdad Battery really an electric battery?</b></font><br>
          The 'Baghdad Battery' is an earthenware jar preserved in the Iraq Museum, 
          Baghdad. It dates to about the 5th or 6th century AD and consists of 
          an earthenware shell with a cylinder of copper set in asphalt and an 
          iron rod in the centre. The jar was first described by the German archaeologist 
          Wilhelm Konig who thought that it looked like an electric battery. When 
          a reproduction was filled with an electrolyte it produced about two 
          volts. If this theory is correct, the batteries could have been used 
          for electroplating. However, most scientists and archaeologists today 
          do not accept the electric battery theory as there is no evidence that 
          this technique was used in antiquity. It is more likely that the jar 
          and its contents were used in a magical ritual.<a name="lens"></a></font></p>

          This 'lens' was found in 1850 in the course of A.H. Layard's excavations 
          in the North-West Palace at Nimrud (Iraq) and probably dates to about 
          the 8th century BC. It is normally on display in Room 55 (Later Mesopotamia 
          Gallery), case 9 at the British Museum. It is an oval 'lens' of ground 
          rock crystal with one plane and one slightly convex face. It has often 
          been regarded as an optical lens and as such would be the oldest known 
          lens in the world. However, most experts today agree that it would have 
          been of little or no practical use as a lens, and interpret it as a 
          piece of decorative inlay.<a name="ziggurat"></a><br>

          is a ziggurat?</font></b> <br>
          A ziggurat is a multi-storey platform with a temple on the summit. Such 
          structures are first found in southern Mesopotamia dating from about 
          2,200 BC, and continued to be constructed until 550 BC, also being imitated 
          in the north by the Assyrians. There are three main theories about the 
          origins of ziggurats. There is the theory that they were developed as 
          a means of elevating grain to keep it dry during spring flooding. Another 
          idea suggests that they are artificial mountains representing the original 
          home of the Sumerians. However, the most widely held theory is that 
          the ziggurat was seen as a ladder to heaven, with the shrine on the 
          summit elevating the priests to the gods themselves. The ziggurat served 
          as the focal point of the city and would be visible from afar. The largest 
          surviving ziggurat is at Chogha Zanbil in Iran. It was built in the 
          13th century BC and stands 100 metres square and 24 metres tall, although 
          this is thought to be just under half its original height. The best 
          preserved ziggurat is at Ur in southern Mesopotamia, built in about 
          2110 BC.<a name="astronomy"></a><br>

          <font size="2" color="#000066">What role did astronomy play in the ancient 
          Near East?</font></b></font><br>
          There was very little distinction in the ancient Near East between astronomy 
          and astrology. The observation and recording of celestial phenomena 
          were mainly for the purpose of gathering information for the prediction 
          of events, and were a form of divination. A belief in divine signs was 
          linked with objective observation, mathematical calculation and the 
          correct prediction of the movement of celestial bodies. The earliest 
          known systematic interest in celestial events occurs in Babylonian lunar 
          and solar omens in about 1700 BC. These omens concerned observations 
          of the moon, sun, planets and stars, as well as earthquakes and weather 
          patterns, and they were linked to predictions about the king and state. 
          In the Neo-Assyrian period scholars regularly observed the heavens and 
          made reports and predictions about political and economic events. The 
          purpose of the reports was to inform the king of propitious times for 
          certain activities, and to protect him against evil portents. Later 
          developments, in the Achaemenid period and after, included the development 
          of personal horoscopes, the invention of the zodiac in Babylonia in 
          about 500 BC, and the practice of keeping astronomical diaries recording 
          lunar, planetary, meteorological, economic, political and other events.<a name="fro"></a>
