            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Merv was one 
              of the major ancient cities of southwest Central Asia and was controlled 
              by a succession of Iranian, Greek, Turkish and Central Asian rulers 
              and governors. It is situated in the modern state of Turkmenistan 
              which was formerly part of the Soviet Union. Intermittent American, 
              Russian and Soviet archaeological excavations have been conducted 
              at the site since 1890. From 1992-2000 nine seasons of excavations 
              and surveys were conducted as part of the International Merv Project 
              [IMP]- a collaboration between the British Museum, University College 
              London and the former Academy of Sciences of Turkmenistan jointly 
              represented and respectively directed by Dr St J. Simpson (Department 
              of the Ancient Near East), Dr G. Herrmann and Dr K. Kurbansakhatov. 
              The archaeological significance of Merv chiefly lies in the information 
              it can provide on the interrelationship of politics, geography and 
              material culture at a major city site at the interface of Central 
              Asia and Iran. Important insights have been made into how the city 
              developed over a long period and how significant changes were made 
              to the use of space. </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The excavations 
              have also revealed the exceptionally and unexpectedly well preserved 
              fortifications, including one of the finest Seleucid city walls 
              to be discovered. Two residential areas belonging to the Sasanian 
              period were excavated, one in the citadel and the other in the lower 
              city. These have provided important well stratified and closely 
              dated groups of artefactual and environmental material which are 
              among the first of their type to be recovered from a major Sasanian 
              site. The discovery of cotton seeds from 5th century and later contexts 
              is the first occasion that remains of this crop have been identified 
              at a Sasanian site and suggest that cotton textile manufacture was 
              an important economic component of the city. The discovery of a 
              9th-10th century workshop specialising in the manufacture of crucible 
              steel was another major achievement as this was not only the earliest 
              to be identified but also confirms in detail the technical processes 
              described by Early Islamic writers. Further excavations conducted 
              in the medieval city revealed drastic rebuilding of the exceptional 
              fortifications and the aftermath of the overwhelming Mongol sack 
              of Merv in 1221 which precipitated a considerable decline in the 
              standard of living in the former Seljuk citadel. </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The city of 
              Merv appears to have been founded by Cyrus the Great (559-530) when 
              this region was part of the eastern Achaemenid empire. The Achaemenid 
              remains are deeply buried beneath later occupation levels but appear 
              to be limited to that part of the site known today as Erk Kala. 
              This is not the earliest period of occupation in the Merv oasis 
              however. Other archaeological surveys and excavations in the northern 
              part of the oasis have revealed extensive remains of village and 
              urban life beginning in the 3rd millennium BC. During this time 
              the region flourished as part of a distinctive Bronze Age culture 
              known as the Bactria-Margiana Archaeological Complex [BMAC] which 
              enjoyed close links with that of eastern Iran. </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Despite some 
              later secondary sources, there is no reliable evidence that Alexander 
              the Great (356-323) ever visited Merv although he certainly campaigned 
              to the north and east following his overthrow of the Achaemenid 
              Empire. However, the city continued to be occupied during the following 
              Seleucid period when it was officially refounded in his own name 
              by Antiochus I (281-261) as Antioch Margiana. During this period 
              the city was drastically enlarged with the construction of new Greek-style 
              fortifications enclosing a roughly rectangular city measuring more 
              than two kilometres across. It is likely that other features of 
              Greek cities, such as gymnasia and theatres, were also constructed 
              - as in the case of the city at Ai Khanum in northern Afghanistan 
              - but if so these still remain to be discovered. </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The previous 
              settlement at Erk Kala now became a separately fortified citadel 
              for the lower city, which is known today as Gyaur Kala. Occupation 
              continued here without a break for the following thousand years 
              throughout the Greco-Bactrian, Parthian and Sasanian periods. The 
              complete sequence of Sasanian coins struck at Merv not only indicate 
              that the city was taken during the latter part of the reign of Ardashir 
              I (ca 220-240) but that it remained under direct Sasanian rule throughout 
              this four-hundred year period. Textual and archaeological evidence 
              also indicates that the city was populated with a diverse range 
              of religious faiths ranging from the official Zoroastrian religion 
              to Nestorian Christians, Buddhists and Manichaeans. The last Sasanian 
              ruler, Yazdgard III (633-651) was murdered close to the city and 
              the Sasanian military governor [marzban] Mahawayh b. Mafanah b. 
              Fahd surrendered to the approaching Arab army.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> This marks 
              the beginning of the Arab Conquest of Central Asia and a further 
              chapter in the history of the city. Merv initially served as a springboard 
              for the further advances of the Arab army into Central Asia and 
              attracted Arab settlers and probably early converts to Islam. The 
              area of the old Sasanian city in Gyaur Kala was gradually abandoned 
              to become an industrial suburb with ceramic and metal workshops 
              east of the new city which developed between the Raziq and Majan 
              canals. Nevertheless Merv achieved some political spotlight in February 
              748 when Abu Muslim (d. 750) established a new Abbasid dynasty at 
              Merv, from where he directed his armies to conquer Iran and Iraq 
              and establish a new capital at Baghdad. Thereafter Merv remained 
              a provincial capital except for a brief period from 813 to 818 when 
              it effectively became capital of the Islamic world during a period 
              of temporary residency by the caliph al-Ma'mun. From the 9th to 
              early 11th centuries Merv was governed by successive Tahirid and 
              Samanid rulers but remained secondary in importance to the regional 
              capital of Nishapur in Iranian Khurasan. </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The great revival 
              in the fortunes of Merv was under the Seljuks who established it 
              as an eastern capital from 1037 to 1157. The golden age of this 
              period was the reign of Sultan Sanjar (d. 1157), whose tomb still 
              dominates the centre of the medieval city-site of Sultan Kala. Sanjar 
              also established a new citadel which was located at the northeast 
              corner of the city. This is now called Shahriyar Ark and traces 
              of various ruined buildings survive inside. The close of his reign 
              was marked by misfortune as he was captured by Ghuzz Turkmen tribesmen 
              and held in captivity for three years while his city was pillaged. 
              The decades following his death were marked by further political 
              struggles between the Khwarazmshahs and the Ghurid rulers of northern 
              Afghanistan but these were brought to a dramatic end in February 
              1221 when a Mongol army commanded by Tolui, son of Genghis Khan, 
              besieged Merv. Its surrender was followed by the slaughter of most 
              of the inhabitants according to Islamic writers. Despite reoccupation 
              under the Ilkhanids, the city never seriously recovered. After the 
              death of Timur in 1405, his son Shah-Rukh (d. 1447) rebuilt the 
              dam on the river Murghab and founded a new town a short distance 
              south of Sultan Kala at a spot known as Abdulla Khan Kala after 
              the Shaybanid Uzbek ruler Abd Allah b. Iskander (1006-1583/88) and 
              next to the present town of Bayram Ali. This flourished for a century 
              under the Timurids but thereafter was caught up in political and 
              military struggles between the Safavids and Uzbeks. </font></p>
