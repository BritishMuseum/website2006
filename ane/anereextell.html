            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Tell es Sa'idiyeh, 
              identified as the biblical city of Zarethan, lies at the heart of 
              the central Jordan Valley. The huge, double occupation mound occupies 
              a key strategic position, commanding the crossroads of two major 
              trade routes and dominating some of the richest and most fertile 
              agricultural land east of the River Jordan.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Excavations 
              undertaken since 1985 by a British Museum expedition under the direction 
              of Jonathan Tubb have revealed the great antiquity of the site's 
              occupational history, with settlement phases extending from the 
              Early Islamic period of the 7th century AD, as far back at least 
              as the Early Bronze Age of the 3rd millennium BC. </font>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Excavations 
              have shown that already by about 2900 BC, Tell es-Sa'idiyeh was 
              a large and prosperous city, with well-constructed architecture 
              and evidence for highly developed municipal planning.</font>
            <p> 
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The most significant 
              finding in this Early Bronze Age phase has been of a large palace 
              complex on the Lower Tell, with areas set aside for olive oil production 
              and storage, wine-making and textile preparation. These activities 
              were conducted on an industrial scale, clearly designed for international 
              commerce. The pottery and other artefacts recovered from this early 
              city display a level of refinement and sophistication unparalleled 
              elsewhere in the Levant.</font>
            <p> 
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Equally remarkable 
              discoveries relate to the city of the 12th century BC, where excavations 
              have uncovered evidence to suggest that Tell es-Sa'idiyeh, like 
              Beth Shan or Gaza on the other side of the Jordan River, was a major 
              centre for the Egyptian control of Canaan during the final years 
              of its New Kingdom empire. Substantial architecture, including an 
              elaborate water system and Egyptian-style public buildings have 
              been found on the Upper Mound. The same strong Egyptian component 
              is also found in the contemporary cemetery which was found to have 
              been cut into the long-abandoned and eroded ruins of the Early Bronze 
              Age city on the Lower Mound.</font>
            <p> 
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The expedition 
              has excavated, to date, some 450 graves, and many of these show 
              unusual Egyptian features, both in terms of the grave-goods and 
              the burial customs. See, for example, an <a href=compass/ixbin/goto?id=OBJ4985 target="_blank">ivory
              cosmetic box in the shape of a fish</a>.</font>
