            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Excavations 
              were begun in 1991 at a relatively small tell, Jerablus Tahtani, 
              situated close to the ancient capital of Carchemish on the banks 
              of the Euphrates in northern Syria. Conducted by Edgar Peltenburg 
              of the University of Edinburgh, and supported by the British Museum, 
              these excavations represent the British contribution to the Syrian 
              government's International Tishreen Dam Rescue Project, an international 
              initiative aimed at retrieving information from sites likely to 
              be flooded by the creation of a 60 km long reservoir.</font></p>
            <p></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The results 
              of the excavations have provided substantial new evidence for the 
              4th-3rd millennium BC cultural sequence in the Middle Euphrates 
              river valley. The earliest remains belong to a local Late Chalcolithic 
              occupation. Above this were found buildings and artefacts characteristic 
              of the Uruk culture, demonstrating the precocious expansion of this 
              Mesopotamian culture into northern Syria in the late 4th millennium 
              BC.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Part of a domestic 
              complex has been excavated which included evidence for bitumen processing 
              and textile preparation. A fine assemblage of pottery was recovered 
              as well as sealings for the administration of goods, decorated alabaster 
              vessels, metal pins and beads.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Uruk settlement 
              declined as a result of flooding of the Euphrates. The following 
              Early Bronze Age occupation consisted initially of a small open 
              village. However, in the subsequent phase of this period, the site 
              was strongly defended. A fort was constructed consisting of a warren 
              of mud-brick walls with paved passages and drains. A postern gate 
              with flanking towers was discovered, together with a terrace leading 
              to a passage giving access to the Euphrates.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Several intra-mural 
              tombs were found belonging to this phase, but the most spectacular 
              find was of a huge extra-mural tomb containing 13 bodies accompanied 
              by objects of gold, silver, rock crystal, ivory and bronze and more 
              than 1000 pottery vessels. Once again, this Early Bronze Age settlement 
              was brought to an end by massive flooding and occupation was not 
              resumed until late in the Iron Age.</font></p>
