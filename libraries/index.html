        Libraries and Archives was established in April 2001, under the general 
        direction of the David Eccles Librarian, to extend and develop library 
        and archive services throughout the Museum. The Museum holds some 350,000 
        books, offprints, pamphlets and many periodical publications, in libraries 
        spread around the buildings, including the Paul Hamlyn Library, the Museum's 
        Central Library and in many curatorial and departmental libraries. The 
        Museum Archives document the history of the Museum and are designated 
        as public records.</font> 
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><i>Note: The British 
        Museum no longer holds the national collections of printed books, manuscripts 
        and journals. Please contact the <a href="http://www.bl.uk" target="_blank">British

        everyone who visits the Museum. Funded by The Paul Hamlyn Foundation, 
        the library aims to help visitors find out more about the Museum's collections 
        and the cultures represented here. The subject-matter is very wide-ranging, 
        including archaeology, history, art, architecture and much more, and there 
        is a substantial and developing children's section. The online catalogue 
        can be consulted at terminals in the Reading Room, and it is hoped that 
        it will soon be available over the internet. The library is still growing 
        - some 13,000 of a planned 20-25,000 books have been acquired so far. 
        Photocopying facilities are available. Books may not be borrowed from 
        the Library but are always available for reference during opening hours.</font></p>

        library for museum staff, and members of the public by special arrangement. 
        Started some 20 years ago, it provides books and journals on a wide range 
        of subjects, such as museology and collecting, and scholarly reference 
        works of interest to curators throughout the Museum. The library is particularly 
        strong on the history of the British Museum and holds a copy of every 
        BM publication. There is also a collection of British Museum posters and 
        postcards. At present dispersed in several locations around the building 
        the library will move in early 2002 into a permanent home in the former 
        Sanskrit Library. It will then be more easily accessible for readers, 
        and will also incorporate a reading room for visitors who wish to consult 
        the archives, as well as books from the House of Commons Old Library to 
        be housed in the <a href="../kingslibrary/index.html">King's Library</a>

        to the departmental Study Rooms. A major cataloguing project is planned

        the Museum and outside, over the internet. To find out more about the

        The Archives of the British Museum consist of the administrative records 
        of the Museum's Trustees and Directors which have been selected for permanent 
        preservation for their evidential, administrative or research value. These 
        are public records, date from the Museum's foundation in 1753 to the present 
        day and illuminate every aspect of the Museum's official activities including 
        the meetings of its Trustees, its acquisitions, administration, finance, 
        buildings, staff, exhibitions, publications and excavations. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Archival material 
        acquired through donation or purchase, and relevant to the history of 
        the Museum and its activities, is also held here. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">This wide-ranging 
        archive is also a rich visual resource and includes sketches, architectural 
        plans and drawings, scrapbooks, press cuttings and photographs. A selection 
        of images from the Archives will be found on <a href="../compass" target="_blank">COMPASS.</a> 
        </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Documentation relating 
        to the history of the British Museum is also held by the <a href="http://www.bl.uk" target="_blank">British 
        Library</a>. This includes the records of the former British Museum Library 
        departments (prior to the establishment of the British Library in 1973) 
        and collections within the Department of Manuscripts. However, pre-1973 
        Reading Room records are held by the British Museum. The records of the 
        Office of Works and its successors relating to the development of the 
        British Museum building are held at the <a href="http://www.pro.gov.uk" target="_parent">Public 
        Record Office</a> at Kew.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> The Museum Archives 
        section also has responsibility for museum-wide records management under 
        the Head of Archives and Departmental Record Officer. The Museum's curatorial 
        and administrative departments retain their own records. These are also 
        public records but, as yet, do not have archival status. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Access to the Museum's 
        Archives is via the Archives Student's Room which is open to the public 
        on Tuesdays and Thursdays (10am-1pm & 2pm-4.30pm) by appointment. Requests 
        for access to departmental records should be sent to the Head(s) of the 
        department(s) concerned. The British Museum is committed to public access 
        to its records in line with current legislation and the Government's policy 
        as set out in the 'Modernising Government' White Paper. The Museum is 
        now actively involved in the PRO's PROcat online cataloguing project and
