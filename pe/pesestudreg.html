      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">2. All students wishing 
        to study antiquities in the Study Room must apply in writing giving at 
        least seven working days notice. The application should indicate the purpose 
        of the research and the objects to be consulted, correct identification 
        by registration or catalogue number is essential. The number of antiquities 
        that can be brought to the Study Room on any one occasion will be restricted 
        to a manageable quantity. </font> 
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">3. Students who are 
        not already known personally to a member of the Department must provide 
        a letter of introduction or other reference from their Professor, supervisor 
        or other qualified person. </font> 
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">4. On arrival all 
        visitors to the Study Room must write their name, home address, any temporary 
        address in this country and telephone number where contact can be made, 
        in block letters in the visitors' book in the waiting room. Evidence of 
        identity (e.g. passport, driving licence) will be required before admittance. 
        </font> 
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">5. Students are requested, 
        where possible to leave all coats, umbrellas and bags in the main Museum 
        Cloakrooms. Visitors' bags brought to the Study Room may be searched on 
        arrival and departure. Personal belongings, except materials and equipment 
        to be used in the study, must be kept away from the area in which the 
        objects are studied and will be deposited in a designated area. The Trustees 
        of the Museum accept no liability for any loss or damage to the personal 
        possessions of any student. </font> 
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">6. All materials and 
        equipment must be approved by the Study Room Supervisor before use. No 
        metal measuring instruments or template formers may be brought into contact 
        with objects. Ink, in bottles or fountain pens, must not be used and when 
        consulting archive material pencil must be used. Tracing around or taking 
        rubbings from objects, is not permitted, except by arrangement with the 
        supervisor. </font> 
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">7. All objects must 
        be transferred from storage areas or display by curatorial staff. Students 
        are required to acknowledge receipt of objects by signing at the bottom 
        of the 'Application to Study Antiquities' form.</font> 
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> 8. Visitors are not 
        permitted in storage areas unless accompanied by a curator. </font> 
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">9. All objects must 
        be handled as little and as carefully as possible. If they have to be 
        handled then clean hands are essential and some objects may only be handled 
        whilst wearing gloves. These will be specified by the Study Room Supervisor 
        and suitable gloves provided. Any handling instructions given by curatorial 
        staff must be observed and the handling of objects will be monitored by 
        Study Room staff. </font> 
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">10. If it is necessary 
        to pick up an object for examination, it must be held over the foam sheet 
        provided. </font> 
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">11. Objects not being 
        worked on must be returned to the drawer or tray from which they came. 
        Antiquities must not be left unprotected on tables. </font> 
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">12. Objects and books 
        must not be removed from the study tables without permission from the 
        Study Room Supervisor. </font> 
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">13. Accidents, whether 
        resulting in damage to objects or not, must be reported immediately to 
        the Study Room Supervisor. </font> 
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">14. Smoking is not 
        allowed anywhere in the Museum. Food and drink must not be consumed at 
        the study tables. </font> 
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">15. Students must 
        ask for permission to take photographs, for personal study purposes, and 
        this is at the discretion of the relevant curator. Permission is granted 
        on condition that extreme care is exercised in setting up the camera and 
        handling the objects and that other students are not inconvenienced. Alternatively, 
        the Museum's Photographic Service undertakes public orders, please ask 
        the supervisor for information. </font> 
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">16. Visitors may not 
        leave the Study Room until the Study Room Supervisor is satisfied that 
        all objects provided for study are accounted for and in good order. (This 
        process can take some time, and you may be asked to conclude your studies 
        early in order for this object check to be completed). Students should 
        ensure that the Supervisor signs the application form acknowledging their 
        return. </font> 
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">17. It may be necessary 
        to close the Study Room without notice in case of shortage of staff or 
        an emergency e.g. fire or security alert. The Museum has set procedures 
        to be followed in an emergency and for your own safety, any instructions 
        given by museum staff must be acted upon immediately. This may involve 
        evacuating the building and students must accept that there may not be 
        time for the dismantling of apparatus such as cameras. </font> 
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">18. Failure to observe 
        these rules may result in the temporary or permanent withdrawal of study 
        facilities. Visitors who are not already known personally to a member 
        of the Department must provide a letter of introduction or other reference 
        from a Professor, supervisor or other qualified person.</font>
