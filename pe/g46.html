                as cultural movements in Europe between 1400 and 1550. Medals and 
                coins provide the historical and political framework for the displays,

                The theme of trade and discovery, a defining feature of the the 
                post-medieval transition, is illustrated almost entirely by artefacts 
                which were once traded commodities, from Rhenish stoneware ceramics 
                and English cloth seals to Dutch tobacco boxes and Chinese export 
                porcelain. Porcelain from shipwrecks in the South China Sea or gold 
                and silver ingots from Spanish galleons sunk in the Caribbean form 
                spectacular evidence for the boom in international trade following 
                colonisation in the 17th and 18th centuries.&nbsp;</font> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" 
            size=2><br>
                <br>
                The success of the cross-Channel trade in maiolica and stoneware 
                from the 16th century and the long-distance supply of Chinese porcelain 
                a century later stimulated several attempts at native production 
                during the 17th century. Excavations on the site of John Dwight's 
                Fulham Pottery, founded in 1672,&nbsp; produced evidence not only 
                for the earliest evidence for stoneware manufacture in Britain and 
                but also pioneering experiments in the manufacture of Oriental-style 
                porcelain some four decades in advance of commercial&nbsp; production 
              in Germany. </font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size=2>Selections from 
                the Department’s rich collections of 18th century artefacts illuminate 
                key events and demonstrate the wealth of Europe, many parts of which 
                were subject to absolute rule. The British monarchy was under threat 
                from the House of Stuart, especially in 1715 and 1745. The role 
                of Parliament was evolving, particularly through the events associated 
                with John Wilkes MP who fought for free speech;&nbsp; elections 
                were riotous affairs. Public interest and involvement is evident 
                from the survival of engraved glasses, painted and printed ceramics, 
                ivories, enamels and tokens and medals. England, France and Spain 
                were continually extending their Empire, coming into conflict in 
                both Europe and the New World. The American War of Independence 
                in 1776&nbsp; and the French Revolution in 1789 left both profoundly 
                changed.&nbsp; Battles, executions and even philosophical movements 
                and scientific discoveries have left their trace in objects displayed 
              in the gallery. </font></p>

                loan a fascinating group of Tudor jewellery associated with the 
                life and legacy of Sir Thomas More (1477/8-1535), one of the outstanding 
                figures of the Tudor age. The group comprises two seal-dies, a cameo 
                with a bust of the Virgin Mary, and two pendants. Only one item 
                can be directly associated with More himself: a silver seal die 
                with his arms and crest of a Moor’s head, which he had made to commemorate 
                his office in Henry VIII’s Household as Sub-Treasurer of England 
                between 1521-24. Another jewel made during his lifetime, which may 
                have been his, is a gold reliquary in the form of a cross with delicate 
                enamelled decoration and pendant pearls. A second reliquary pendant 
                appears to have been made to commemorate More, probably in the mid 
                1550s.</font> <font
