      <P><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size=2>2. All students

      <P><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size=2>3. Students who are 
      not already known personally to a member of the Department must provide a 
      letter of introduction or other reference from their Professor, supervisor

      <P><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size=2>4. On arrival all 
      visitors to the Study Room must write their name, home address, any 
      temporary address in this country and telephone number where contact can

      before admittance. </FONT>
      <P><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size=2>5. Students are

      searched on arrival and departure. Personal belongings, except materials 
      and equipment to be used in the study, must be kept away from the area in 
      which the objects are studied and will be deposited in a designated area. 
      The Trustees of the Museum accept no liability for any loss or damage to 
      the personal possessions of any student. </FONT>
      <P><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size=2>6. All materials and 
      equipment must be approved by the Study Room Supervisor before use. No 
      metal measuring instruments or template formers may be brought into 
      contact with objects. Ink, in bottles or fountain pens, must not be used 
      and when consulting archive material pencil must be used. Tracing around 
      or taking rubbings from objects, is not permitted, except by arrangement 
      with the supervisor. </FONT>
      <P><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size=2>7. All objects must be 
      transferred from storage areas or display by curatorial staff. Students 
      are required to acknowledge receipt of objects by signing at the bottom of 
      the 'Application to Study Antiquities' form.</FONT> 
      <P><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size=2>8. Visitors are not 
      permitted in storage areas unless accompanied by a curator. </FONT>
      <P><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size=2>9. All objects must be 
      handled as little and as carefully as possible. If they have to be handled 
      then clean hands are essential and some objects may only be handled whilst 
      wearing gloves. These will be specified by the Study Room Supervisor and 
      suitable gloves provided. Any handling instructions given by curatorial 
      staff must be observed and the handling of objects will be monitored by 
      Study Room staff. </FONT>
      <P><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size=2>10. If it is necessary 
      to pick up an object for examination, it must be held over the foam sheet 
      provided. </FONT>
      <P><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size=2>11. Objects not being 
      worked on must be returned to the drawer or tray from which they came. 
      Antiquities must not be left unprotected on tables. </FONT>
      <P><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size=2>12. Objects and books 
      must not be removed from the study tables without permission from the 
      Study Room Supervisor. </FONT>
      <P><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size=2>13. Accidents, whether 
      resulting in damage to objects or not, must be reported immediately to the 
      Study Room Supervisor. </FONT>
      <P><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size=2>14. Smoking is not 
      allowed anywhere in the Museum. Food and drink must not be consumed at the 
      study tables. </FONT>
      <P><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size=2>15. Students must ask 
      for permission to take photographs, for personal study purposes, and this 
      is at the discretion of the relevant curator. Permission is granted on 
      condition that extreme care is exercised in setting up the camera and 
      handling the objects and that other students are not inconvenienced. 
      Alternatively, the Museum's Photographic Service undertakes public orders, 
      please ask the supervisor for information. </FONT>
      <P><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size=2>16. Visitors may not 
      leave the Study Room until the Study Room Supervisor is satisfied that all 
      objects provided for study are accounted for and in good order. (This 
      process can take some time, and you may be asked to conclude your studies 
      early in order for this object check to be completed). Students should 
      ensure that the Supervisor signs the application form acknowledging their 
      return. </FONT>
      <P><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size=2>17. It may be 
      necessary to close the Study Room without notice in case of shortage of 
      staff or an emergency e.g. fire or security alert. The Museum has set 
      procedures to be followed in an emergency and for your own safety, any 
      instructions given by museum staff must be acted upon immediately. This 
      may involve evacuating the building and students must accept that there 
      may not be time for the dismantling of apparatus such as cameras. </FONT>
      <P><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size=2>18. Failure to observe 
      these rules may result in the temporary or permanent withdrawal of study 
      facilities. Visitors who are not already known personally to a member of 
      the Department must provide a letter of introduction or other reference 
      from a Professor, supervisor or other qualified person.</FONT>
