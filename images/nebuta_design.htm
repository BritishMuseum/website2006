        construction and design</font></b></font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFCCFF"><b>The 
        themes illustrated in the floats paraded in the Nebuta Festival in Aomori 
        are taken from historical, religious and folk tales, but also contain 
        visual puns referring to current events. The n<i>ebuta</i> made for The 
        British Museum in 2001 is entitled ‘Minamoto no Yoshitsune crossing the 
        sea'. Minamoto no Yoshitsune was a 12th century warrior whose popularity 
        and success as a military leader posed a threat to his brother, Minamoto 
        no Yoritomo, who had him killed. He became the tragic hero of many tales, 
        including one in which he survives and flees Japan over the seas with 
        the help of his powerful horse. This is the scene depicted on the <i>nebuta</i> 
        and parallels the voyage of the <i>nebuta</i> artists crossing the seas 
        to the UK to construct the festival float in The British Museum. </b></font></p>
      <p><b><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFCCFF">A 
        painting or sketch of the scene forms the visual basis from which the 
        artists elaborate the three-dimensional giant form of the <i>nebuta</i> 
        itself. The paintings also announce the artistic programme for the Aomori 
        festival each year.</font></b></p>
      <p><b><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFCCFF">The 
        <i>nebuta</i> is made of a wood and wire structure, covered with paper. 
        As this work progresses, an electrical engineer installs between 500 and 
        800 lightbulbs (and sometimes more) on the inside. The <i>nebuta</i> is 
        then decorated with ink and paints. Melted paraffin wax is used to provide 
        a barrier between the colours and to create the translucent effect for 
        which the <i>nebuta</i> are so famous.</font> </b></p>
