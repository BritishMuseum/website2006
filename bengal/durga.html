<p>To launch the Voices of Bengal season, craftsmen from Bengal created a spectacular image of the goddess Durga killing the buffalo-headed demon Mahisha, in the Great Court. The image was made using straw, clay and paint, and visitors were able to see the whole process, from the construction of the initial wooden structure, to the painting of the giant figures on the tableau, which were then ornamented and dressed. It is a rare,  outside of Bengal, to be able to witness the remarkable skills of the West Bengali craftsmen creating the image of Durga.<br>
  <br>
There is also a display of photography by John Williams of the construction of images of the goddess Durga in Calcutta currently on show in the Clore Centre foyer. 
</p>
</p>
<p class="style1">The construction project was organised by the British Museum, the <a href="http://www.londonpuja.com/">London Durga Puja Dusserah Committee</a> (LDPDC) and the Crafts Council of West Bengal. The image of Durga was created by Nemai Chandra Pal (master-craftsman) and his two assistant image-makers&nbsp;Biswajit Chakraborty and Madhu Sudan Pal. Construction took place between 12 August and 24 September in preparation for the worship of the goddess during the Puja festival (Durga Puja), which the LDPDC organised at the Camden Centre (Bidborough Street, London, WC1). The images were then ritually immersed in the Thames by Putney Bridge on 2 October 2006.<br>
    <br>
    The British Museum would like to acknowledge the benefit of 
experience gained from the Scottish Indian Arts Forum and National Museums of Scotland's <em>Making a Durga</em> project in Edinburgh 2002.<br>
<br>

The British Museum would also like to acknowledge the support of the Indian Council for Cultural Relations (ICCR) with the 
Durga project.</p>
