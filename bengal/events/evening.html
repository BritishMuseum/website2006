  <h3><a name="guardian" id="guardian"></a>Faith, nation, culture: <BR>
    The Guardian/British Museum Public Forum: <BR>
    What   Bengal's history tells us about living with multiple identities?  </h3>
  <span class="date">Friday 1 December, 18.30 <br>
BP Lecture Theatre</span>
  <p class="info">Bengal has arguably the longest history of engagement between   East and West, stretching back over several centuries of settlement, with   Calcutta once the capital city of the British in India. For Bengalis, the   British were just one chapter in a long history of cultural exchange and   accommodation. That history has seen a cultural heritage shared across faiths   (in particular, Hinduism and Islam) and then split, in the twentieth century,   across two nations: India and Bangladesh. How does this story of multiple   identities - of faith, nation, culture - shed light on the challenges of   globalisation in the twenty-first century as many Bengalis migrate across the   sub-continent and across the globe? How do those diaspora identities, whether in   Tower Hamlets or Delhi, refashion their past and what insights can history can   offer for the increasing primacy of religious identity?<span class="price"> </span> </p>
