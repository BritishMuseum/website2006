            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Curators and 
              Scientists got a big surprise when x-raying a group of &#145;crushed 
              skulls' from the Great Death Pit at Ur, dating to around 2500BC. 
              Instead of bone fragments, two stunning gold, silver and lapis lazuli 
              head-dresses were revealed, which have drawn little attention since 
              the objects came to the Museum over seventy years ago. One of the 
              x-rays is shown here.</font></p>

            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Excavations 
              conducted at the city of Ur, in southern Iraq, by Leonard Woolley 
              in the 1920s uncovered magnificent burials indicating the existence 
              of a high status group within the city's population. Individuals 
              were buried with rich grave goods made from gold, silver, carnelian 
              and lapis lazuli. They were accompanied to their graves by attendants, 
              both men and women. The Great Death Pit was the largest grave and 
              held seventy-four attendants, sacrificed to accompany the main burial. 
              Little was left of the main tomb-chamber, as it had been robbed 
              in antiquity, but the mass human sacrifice that had accompanied 
              this individual to their grave remained intact. Most of the attendants 
              were female and were richly attired. Next to each was a bowl and 
              it has been suggested that the attendants had died by drinking poison.<br>
              <br>
              The two head-dresses had been registered as crushed skulls (with 
              fragments of jewellery), and appeared rather dull, rather shapeless 
              masses with no identifying features. During the excavations Woolley 
              poured wax over objects to hold them together during excavation 
              and transport to London, but this has the effect of completely obscuring 
              the detail, as the wax has since blackened. The objects were x-rayed 
              to try to identify the teeth belonging to the occupants of the grave, 
              which would have indicated their age at the time of death. In fact, 
              there were no teeth, only gold and silver made into fabulous jewellery. 
              The experts are delighted with the find as it will allow them to 
              apply modern techniques to investigate the way that the head-dresses 
              were made. The Museum has other head-dresses of this type but these 
              have been heavily restored, while the re-discovered ones are nearly 
              complete and have not been touched since they came out of the ground. 
              They are therefore closer to their original condition and can thus 
              tell us a great deal about technology 4500 years ago. </font></p>
