            <h3> Prime cut: Redating the jeweller's wheel </h3>
			<p> <font size="-1">The engraving wheel has been the most important 
              tool for working precious stones and gems for thousands of years. 
              New work at the British Museum, sponsored by the Townley Group and 
              the British Museum Society, has dated this innovation to over 1000 
              years later than has been generally believed. This was done by careful 
              study of the engravings on cylinder seals from ancient Mesopotamia, 
              using a scanning electron microscope. From about 3000 BC, designs 
              were produced by flaking off minute chips of stone, by gouging or 
              hammering with a flint or bronze tool. Wheel-cutting, the standard 
              approach of jewellers in the modern world, was not introduced until 
              about 1600 BC.</font></p>
            <p> <font size="-1"><img src="../images/sealwhl.jpg" width="250" height="211" align="left" alt="Image of the details of a cylinder seal representing a kings head">Cylinder 
              seals were rolled into clay and left an impression which indicated 
              the ownership or authorship of a document in cuneiform writing. 
              They were engraved with images and inscriptions which reveal much 
              information about life in the period. Seals were worn as jewellery 
              by their owners and were frequently made of semi-precious hard stones 
              such as rock crystal, chalcedony and lapis lazuli. These seals provide 
              a record of the techniques used by the craftsmen who engraved them 
              over some 3000 years. </font></p>
            <p><font size="-1">By carefully taking casts of cylinder seals with 
              dental resin, Margaret Sax, Nigel Meeks and Dominique Collon were 
              able to examine the engravings using a scanning electron microscope. 
              They compared these with experimental engravings done in the laboratory 
              to identify the techniques used by the ancient craftsmen. They were 
              then able to build up a chronological sequence for the use of different 
              engraving methods. The introduction of wheel cutting encouraged 
              the production of seals in harder, more precious, stones and allowed 
              a higher throughput. It also allowed the development of a more fluid 
              engraving style. It appears to be part of a complex series of improvements 
              in rotary technology, including the development of the fast potters 
              wheel, and spoked chariot wheels. </font></p>
