            <h3> Europe's Earliest Brass</h3>
            <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"><b>It 
              is not often that we can report being happy to confirm that a metal 
              really is brass and not gold, without having got the word order 
              mixed up!</b></font></p>
            <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">This 
              happened recently following the re-examination of the small foils 
              covering the maker's stamps <i>(Figs. 1 &amp; 2, below, left &amp; 
              right)</i> on a fine iron sword found on the foreshore of the Thames 
              at Syon Reach, Isleworth and which came to the British Museum in 
              1929 <i>(Fig. 3, bottom)</i>. For many years the sword was regarded 
              as being Anglo Saxon, and as such it was examined and the foils 
              analysed and identified as being of brass. This passed without comment, 
              as brass, the alloy of copper and zinc, had become common in Europe 
              during the Roman period. But more recent research has shown that 
              the sword definitely belongs to the Iron Age, to a phase known as 
              La Tene II, which is firmly dated to the 3rd or early 2nd centuries 
              BC. This is, of course, long before the Romans arrived in north 
              west Europe, and suddenly the brass of the foils took on a new significance.<br>

              Before discussing this, we must explain just a little about brass, 
              and why it is important. Zinc ores are quite widespread, and the 
              metal is now very common, but in antiquity zinc metal was all but 
              unknown, and the alloy brass only appeared long after bronze (the 
              alloy of copper and tin), had been in use. This is because zinc 
              is very reactive and volatile when hot, in fact it is a gas when 
              smelted, such that it has to be condensed in special distillation 
              apparatus, well beyond the skills of the ancients (the process was 
              discovered in India about 1,000 years ago, see British Museum Occasional 
              Paper no 50). However, brass could be created directly by melting 
              copper in a crucible, adding some roasted zinc ore and charcoal, 
              then quickly covering with a lid to stop the zinc escaping. Some 
              of the ore would decompose and some of the zinc thus released would 
              dissolve in the copper. It was crude, but it worked, giving a reasonable 
              brass, and in fact variants of the process were still practised 
              in Britain up to about 150 years ago. The process seems to have 
              begun in the first half of the first millennium BC somewhere in 
              the Near or Middle East, and over the next few centuries there are 
              occasional references to <i>oreichalkos</i>, 'mountain' or latterly 
              'golden copper', in the Greek literature of those times.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Only a very 
              few actual pieces of early brass have been identified from the Middle 
              East, and none so far from Europe north of the Alps. Hence the importance 
              of the Syon Reach sword.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Now that its 
              significance was understood it was necessary to undertake a little 
              more examination. The small stamps were in remarkably good condition, 
              and they do look very golden. We had to be sure that the foils really 
              were ancient and that they really were of brass and not gold.<br>
              <br>
              <img src="../images/Sword5.jpg" width="500" height="131" hspace="45"> 
              </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">The sword itself 
              is in very good condition, typical of many of the finds from the 
              Thames mud and other waterlogged environments, where there is little 
              or no oxygen. Even so there is some iron corrosion on the sword 
              and careful examination with a binocular microscope showed clearly 
              that the corrosion lapped over the edges of the foils, that is, 
              the foils were in place before the corrosion had begun. </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">The foils themselves 
              were completely uncorroded partly due the environment and partly 
              due to the surrounding iron of the sword acting as a sacrificial 
              anode. Re-analysis by X-ray fluorescence confirmed that the metal 
              is indeed brass, containing approximately 15 to 20% of zinc, and 
              no other metals in significant alloying quantities. The composition 
              is striking similar to that found in some brass coins issued in 
              Anatolia in the first century BC, and suggests that this is possibly 
              where the brass was made.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">How the brass 
              got to North West Europe is unknown, but trade between the Mediterranean 
              and Celtic Europe was extensive, and Celtic warriors frequently 
              served as mercenaries in the squabbling states of the Hellenistic 
              world. </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">One such warrior 
              might have returned from the wars with some of this metal to embellish 
              his sword. He might have been disappointed to learn that it was 
              not gold. But, documenting as it does, the arrival of a new metal 
              into Western Europe, we are delighted to report that the golden 
              foils really are of brass!</font></p>
