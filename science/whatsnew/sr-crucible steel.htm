            <h3> Crucible Steel - Bright Steel </h3>
            <p><font size="-1"><img src="../images/CE%20519.jpg" width="300" height="235" align="right"></font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">The 
              wonderfully patterned swords of Damascus steel, made from Indian 
              crucible steel, known as wootz, have always been famous. Perhaps 
              too famous, because they have diverted our attention from the whole 
              range of other items made from crucible steel that were made all 
              over the Islamic Middle East and central Asia, not just in India.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">We have recently 
              investigated this superb 14th century steel mirror made in either 
              Syria or Egypt and found that it is made of crucible steel, and 
              the calligraphic decoration is inlaid with silver and gold. In order 
              to appreciate its interest it is necessary to briefly explain how 
              the steel was made.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">In Medieval 
              times iron and steel were generally made and worked as solid materials, 
              quite simply because their melting temperatures were so high. This 
              meant that the metal was very inhomogeneous in composition, and 
              even worse, contained all sorts of bits of slag and other rubbish 
              that ruined the appearance of the metal. The solution was obvious, 
              melt the metal, unfortunately the problem was equally obvious, how 
              to attain the necessary temperatures in excess of 1400 degrees C 
              and produce crucibles that could hold the molten metal. Recent excavations 
              at Merv in Turkmenistan, in Central Asia, in which the British Museum 
              participated,uncovered the remains of special furnaces that could 
              reach the temperatures required for the production of liquid steel. 
              Fragments of the crucibles made of special clays, the world's first 
              true refractories, were also found.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Our mirror 
              was recently studied as part of a much larger study of Islamic metalwork. 
              It was, of course, not possible to cut a section for examination, 
              but fortunately the mirror has only a slight tarnish and it was 
              possible to lightly polish the edge and reveal the structure of 
              the metal. This showed the metal to be free of inclusions but to 
              contain about 0.5% of carbon evenly distributed through the metal, 
              and analysis showed there was also about a percent of manganese, 
              which is also mentioned by some of the medieval Islamic technical 
              authors.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">This was crucible 
              steel that had been forged into an excellent reflecting surface 
              that would never have bent in use. Being bright and shiny is not 
              a property one normally associates with crucible steel, but some 
              of the contemporary Islamic authors describe it as &#145;bright 
              steel'. Another writer states that sword blades of crucible steel 
              were so bright that the soldiers used them as mirrors when adjusting 
              their turbans.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Much later 
              when crucible steel was first produced in Britain in Sheffield in 
              1738, one of the first customers was Matthew Boulton of Birmingham 
              who wanted it not for its strength or hardness, but to make buttons. 
              Being free of the slag inclusions, they took a better polish. Mirrors 
              are sometimes made of steel now, not because they are especially 
              brilliant reflectors, but because they are relatively vandal proof, 
              and so suitable for public toilets etc. Each age values materials 
              for different qualities!</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">This is the 
              first Islamic steel mirror to be metallographically examined, maybe 
              there are others that are also of &#145;bright steel'.</font> </p>
