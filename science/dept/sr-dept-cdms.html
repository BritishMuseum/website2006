            <h3>Are there any dragons in The British Museum?<img src="../images/dragon.jpg" 
		  alt="A Dragon's Head"  align="left"> </h3>
            <p> <font size="-1">How can such a question be answered in an institution 
              the size of the British Museum? Over 250 years of acquisitions has 
              resulted in documentation systems centred on hand-written registers, 
              catalogues, index cards, excavation/fieldwork reports, and a variety 
              of other documents added to and amended by countless scholars over 
              the years. </font></p>
            <p><font size="-1"> The development of computers has offered a way 
              through this and enabled the Museum to increase the accessibility 
              of its information and the collections themselves. The Museum has 
              a database of over 1.5 million records for almost 2 million individual 
              objects. By having a standardised method of recording the information 
              it is now possible to answer this and other complex enquiries. </font></p>
            <p><font size="-1"> The variation in the styles, levels of detail 
              and content of the various sources of written information is overcome 
              by entering information such as the name of the object, what it 
              is made of, when and where it was made, and who made it. It is possible 
              to search for objects such as bronze vessels made in China or Japan 
              in the 18<SUP>th</SUP> Century. </font></p>
            <p><font size="-1"> Standardising and controlling information is essential 
              to ensure the best possible results are obtained when a user searches 
              the database for particular items; for example, the names of artists 
              represented in the collections of Prints &amp; Drawings or methods 
              of acquisition. </font></p>
            <p><font size="-1"> The Collections Data Management Section has a 
              number of thesauri for controlling information, such as what the 
              object is and what it is made of , which are adaptable to the enormous 
              range of terms in, for example, Ethnography, or to the specificity 
              of some of Medieval and Later's collections. These thesauri are 
              being continually updated and expanded as new areas of the collections 
              are entered and as new objects are acquired. </font></p>
            <p><font size="-1"><img src="../images/dragon-pot.jpg" 
	  align="left"alt="A Porcelain Vase with a Dragon Design"> </font></p>
            <p><font size="-1">So, how about the dragons? By searching a variety 
              of fields (2D design, 3D form, materials, subject/iconography and 
              a free-text description) the Museum currently has 2400 references 
              to dragons. These are made of a variety of materials from silver, 
              gold, bronze and iron to ivory, horn, leather, porcelain and earthenware 
              and date from 2300 BC - 1997 for cultures and periods as widespread 
              as Assyrian and Babylonian, Anglo-Saxon, Byzantine, Medieval, Mughal, 
              Roman Imperial Period in Egypt, Han and Ming Dynasties in China 
              and the Edo Period in Japan. The objects themselves include, amongst 
              other things, shadow puppets, jewellery, swords, seals, costume, 
              vessels, chess-pieces, figures, finger-rings, prints, drawings, 
              netsuke, masks, door-handles, a "ceramic pillow with dragons and 
              flowers", a "skin bag for Dragon's blood" and, of course, a bowl 
              containing "dragon's blood" (resin from a cinnabar tree!). </font></p>
