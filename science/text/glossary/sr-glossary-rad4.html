<h1><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Radiography </font></h1>
<p>Radiographic techniques, similar to those used in hospitals and by dentists, 
  are used in the study of archaeological artefacts. As in medical investigations, 
  radiography reveals internal details that would otherwise be invisible. It is 
  especially useful in museums because it is a non-destructive method, not requiring 
  the removal of any sample. Radiography is a versatile tool: it is used to detect 
  flaws in heavy metal castings but can also be used to provide images of watermarks 
  in thin sheets of paper; it may reveal objects concealed in a soil block excavated 
  from an archaeological site; it can help curators identify heavily corroded 
  artefacts; it can assist scientists to find out how objects were made; and it 
  is very useful to conservators, revealing cracks, corrosion and sometimes previous 
  restorations. </p>
