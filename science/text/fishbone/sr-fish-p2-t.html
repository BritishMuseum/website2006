<h2 >The Study of Ancient Animal Bone?</h2>
<p> <img src="../../images/crc16a2.gif" align="left" alt="Image of Ancient fish remains"> 
  Bone is usually identified by comparing it with reference collections of modern 
  animal bone. This is a skilled specialist task, and often depends on close examination 
  of some very small feature of the bone. While most such work has been conducted 
  looking at the remains of mammals, archaeological fish remains can also have 
  a great deal to tell us. One problem in looking at ancient fish bone is that 
  it can be particularly difficult to identify. It is small, fragile, and is frequently 
  found in very poor condition, with many of the most readily identifiable pieces 
  missing, as can be seen from this group of material from the Bronze Age layers 
  of a site at Ra's al-Hadd in Oman </p>
