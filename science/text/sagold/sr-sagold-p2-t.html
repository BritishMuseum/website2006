<h1>Under the scanning electron microscope</h1>
<p> The <a href="../glossary/sr-glossary-sem.html">scanning electron microscope</a> 
  allows us to see the textures on the surface of the gold, to find out how it 
  was made. We can analyse the gold using X-rays, to find out how pure it is. 
  We can also make very accurate measurements of size. For example, the "pillars" 
  in the photograph are one half of one millimetre across. </p>

<p> By examining the earrings at a high magnification, we were able to see the 
  dendrites in the <a href="sr-sagold-microstructure2.html">microstructure</a>. 
  This showed that the earrings were cast. Along with our historical knowledge 
  of the area, this allowed us to conclude that the goldsmiths used a technique 
  known as lost-wax casting. The Sinú goldsmiths were very skilled at this. European 
  goldsmiths made similar jewellery at this time but they used very different 
  methods. They soldered together many pieces of gold, rather than casting an 
  earring in one piece. </P>
