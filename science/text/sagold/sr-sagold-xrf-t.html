<h1>Energy Dispersive X-ray Fluorescence (ED-XRF)</h1>
<p> X-ray fluorescence is a technique of chemical analysis. It has been called 
  'the curator's dream instrument' because measurements are non-destructive and 
  usually the whole object can be analysed, rather than a sample removed from 
  one. The technique involves aiming an X-ray beam at the surface of an object; 
  this beam is about 2 mm in diameter. </p>

<p > The interaction of X-rays with an object causes secondary (fluorescent) X-rays 
  to be generated. Each element present in the object produces X-rays with different 
  energies. These X-rays can be detected and displayed as a spectrum of intensity 
  against energy: the positions of the peaks identify which elements are present 
  and the peak heights identify how much of each element is present. </p>

<p ALIGN="left"> ED-XRF is accurate and fast (a result can be obtained in a few 
  minutes), but it is not sensitive enough to measure low concentrations such 
  as trace elements (i.e. those present at levels below about 0.1%). However, 
  it will quickly determine the alloy composition of a metal artefact and it can 
  also be used to analyse some non-metallic materials such as ceramics and glass. 
  One limitation of the technique is that only a thin layer, less than 0.1mm, 
  is actually analysed. This can sometimes give misleading results on corroded 
  or plated metals unless the surface is cleaned. </p>
