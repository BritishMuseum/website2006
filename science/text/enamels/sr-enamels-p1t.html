<h1>How were Medieval Enamels Made?</h1>
<img src="../../images/cc330b.gif" alt="Image of the naaman plaque showing captain Naamen in the river being cured by the finger of god and being watched by three observers"> 
<p>Naaman, the captain of the armies of Syria, is being cured of leprosy in the 
  River Jordan (2 Kings V, 14). This plaque dates to the twelfth century and was 
  made in Germany. </p>
<a name="how"> 
<h2>How was the plaque made?</h2>
</a> <img src="../../images/stratfordgs.gif" alt="image of Sketch of person engraving the image into the copper"> 
<p>The plaque is a sheet of copper. First the picture of Naaman and his servants 
  was engraved in the copper. Then coloured glass was ground up and placed in 
  the cells (small hollows) which had been carved out. See the <a href="../glossary/sr-glossary-enamel.html">engraving</a> 
  using an X-ray of the plaque.</p>
<p>The plaque was then placed into an oven at <a href="sr-enamels-red.html">red 
  heat</a> so that the coloured glasses melted in to place. A design made by melting 
  glass onto metal in this way is known as an enamel.</p>
