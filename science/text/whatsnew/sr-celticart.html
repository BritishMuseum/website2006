<h1>Were masterpieces of Celtic art made using old slag?</h1>
<p>Rich red enamels decorate outstanding pieces of early medieval Celtic metalwork, 
  such as the suspension mounts of the hanging bowls from the Sutton Hoo ship 
  burial. It was previously assumed that these enamels were specially made. However, 
  analysis of a range of enamels by British Museum scientists reveals that they 
  differ from other coloured glasses of the period, and appear to be the waste 
  from a metal refining process. </p>
<p>The Celts appear to have had a penchant for red enamel and its origin has always 
  been something of a mystery, but it has been assumed that a large lump of red 
  glass found in the 1850s in County Meath, Ireland was a block of the raw material. 
  New analyses by Colleen Stapleton, Ian Freestone and Sheridan Bowman, however, 
  reveal that the enamels are not related to the glass technology of the period, 
  nor to the red glass lump. They are very rich in lead and copper, and appear 
  to be the waste by-products, or "slag", of a process used to reclaim silver 
  and gold from scrap metal. </p>
<p>The early medieval enamels therefore represent an early example of the recycling 
  of otherwise unwanted material to produce outstanding artwork. The use of slag 
  should in no way be seen to diminish the achievements of the craftsmen, but 
  reflects their skill in selecting the best materials for the task at hand. In 
  fact, the red slag offered some advantages, as it melted at a particularly low 
  temperature and was easier to melt into place than other available glasses. 
  It was sometimes used to 'stick' other colours into place. The investigation 
  was carried out using X-ray microanalysis of the glasses in the scanning electron 
  microscope and X-ray fluorescence analysis in air.</p>
