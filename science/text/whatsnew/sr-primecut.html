  cut: Redating the jeweller's wheel </font></h1>
<p>The engraving wheel has been the most important tool for working precious stones 
  and gems for thousands of years. New work at the British Museum, sponsored by 
  the Townley Group and the British Museum Society, has dated this innovation 
  to over 1000 years later than has been generally believed. This was done by 
  careful study of the engravings on cylinder seals from ancient Mesopotamia, 
  using a scanning electron microscope. From about 3000 BC, designs were produced 
  by flaking off minute chips of stone, by gouging or hammering with a flint or 
  bronze tool. Wheel-cutting, the standard approach of jewellers in the modern 
  world, was not introduced until about 1600 BC.</p>
<p> Cylinder seals were rolled into clay and left an impression which indicated 
  the ownership or authorship of a document in cuneiform writing. They were engraved 
  with images and inscriptions which reveal much information about life in the 
  period. Seals were worn as jewellery by their owners and were frequently made 
  of semi-precious hard stones such as rock crystal, chalcedony and lapis lazuli. 
  These seals provide a record of the techniques used by the craftsmen who engraved 
  them over some 3000 years. </p>
<p>By carefully taking casts of cylinder seals with dental resin, Margaret Sax, 
  Nigel Meeks and Dominique Collon were able to examine the engravings using a 
  scanning electron microscope. They compared these with experimental engravings 
  done in the laboratory to identify the techniques used by the ancient craftsmen. 
  They were then able to build up a chronological sequence for the use of different 
  engraving methods. The introduction of wheel cutting encouraged the production 
  of seals in harder, more precious, stones and allowed a higher throughput. It 
  also allowed the development of a more fluid engraving style. It appears to 
  be part of a complex series of improvements in rotary technology, including 
  the development of the fast potters wheel, and spoked chariot wheels. </p>
