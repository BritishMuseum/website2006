<h1>The Ferrous Metallurgy of Early Clocks and Watches: Studies in Post Medieval 
  Steel</h1>
<p>From the 16th to the 19th centuries there were remarkable changes in man's 
  scientific and technical knowledge, and this is nowhere better exemplified than 
  in ferrous metallurgy. In the 16th century the nature of steel was unknown and 
  its manufacture was necessarily a hit or miss affair. By the 19th century liquid 
  steel of high purity and exact composition was being regularly prepared. This 
  book charts the progress from medieval to scientific production as documented 
  by the careful metallographic examination of clocks and watches. As their movements 
  became ever more compact so the demands made on the steel of the components, 
  above all the springs, became ever more exacting. The book also describes processes 
  such as spring-making and charts the progress of Europe's leading horological 
  centres. In the 16th century London clockwork was pretty poor compared to its 
  continental rivals, but by the 18th century had gained total ascendancy, in 
  no small part due to the quality of the steel being used. </p>
