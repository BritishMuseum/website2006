<h1>X-ray Diffraction Analysis</h1>
<img src="../../images/ca293.gif" alt="Image of X-ray Diffraction Equipment" border="0"  > 
<p> X-ray diffraction analysis is particularly useful in the study of museum objects 
  because it is almost non-destructive. It requires a very small sample, much 
  less than the size of a pin-head, to use the X-ray camera. </p>

<img src="../../images/cx8(xrd).gif" alt="Image of X-ray diffraction pattern" border="0" > 
<p> When X-rays are fired at a crystalline sample placed in the X-ray camera, 
  a proportion are diffracted by the regular crystal structure. These diffracted 
  X-rays produce a pattern of lighter and darker lines on a film. The pattern 
  on the film depends on what is in the sample and by reference to standard data, 
  this pattern can be used as a kind of 'fingerprint' to identify a wide variety 
  of materials. Such materials include corrosion products on metals, pigments 
  used on wall paintings, and inlaid decoration in jewellery. </p>
<p> Unlike techniques such as <a href="sr-tech-xrf3-t.html">X-ray fluorescence 
  (XRF)</a>, <a href="sr-tech-aas3-t.html">atomic absorption spectrometry (AAS)</a>, 
  inductively-coupled plasma/mass spectrometry (ICP/MS) and other methods of chemical 
  analysis that provide information on elemental composition, XRD allows a particular 
  mineral to be identified. </p>

                       > For example, limestone and shell were both used as white 
  inlays on Anglo Saxon brooches (left). The problem is that both limestone (the 
  mineral calcite) and shell (the mineral aragonite) consist chemically of calcium 
  carbonate, so that the chemical analysis alone cannot distinguish between them. 
  Using XRD it was a simple matter to identify the white inlay on the brooch as 
  aragonite, showing that shell had been used. </p>
