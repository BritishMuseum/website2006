<p > Atomic absorption spectrophotometry (AAS) is an analytical technique used 
  to measure a wide range of elements in materials such as metals, pottery and 
  glass. Although it is a destructive technique (unlike <a href="sr-tech-xrf-t.html">ED-XRF</a>), 
  the sample size needed is very small (typically about 10 milligrams - i.e. one 
  hundredth of a gram) and its removal causes little damage. The sample is accurately 
  weighed and then dissolved, often using strong acids. The resulting solution 
  is sprayed into the flame of the instrument and atomised (see schematic diagram). 
  Light of a suitable wavelength for a particular element is shone through the 
  flame, and some of this light is absorbed by the atoms of the sample. The amount 
  of light absorbed is proportional to the concentration of the element in the 
  solution, and hence in the original object. Measurements are made separately 
  for each element of interest in turn to achieve a complete analysis of an object, 
  and thus the technique is relatively slow to use. However, it is very sensitive 
  and it can measure trace elements down to the part per million level, as well 
  as being able to measure elements present in minor and major amounts. </p>
