<h1><font s face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Raman Spectroscopy</font></h1>
<p> <font size="5" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Raman spectroscopy is a 
  technique that enables us to identify not only those materials used in the construction 
  of an object, but also those used in decorating the surface. It can also be 
  used to identify corrosion products, e.g. rust, on the surface of the object.</font></p>
<p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="5"><img src="../../images/ramaneff.gif" width="250" height="167" align="left" alt="Image of light scattering central to the Raman effect.">It 
  works by shining a laser beam onto the surface of the object. Most of this light 
  is reflected off unchanged. However a small proportion interacts with the molecules 
  in the material and is scattered. The scattered portion of light, known as the 
  Raman effect, is collected to produce a spectrum. Each material has a unique 
  spectrum associated with it and therefore each one acts as a fingerprint with 
  which to identify materials. </font></p>

<p><font size="5" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><img src="../../images/raman2.jpg" width="355" height="316" align="right" alt="Image of raman analysing gemstones on a medieval reliquary">However, 
  the Raman effect is very small and until recently its use as an analytical tool 
  was limited by a lack of suitable equipment. Recent advances, particularly the 
  development of lasers, mean that Raman spectroscopy is now widely used to analyse 
  a wide range of materials. These spectra can be used to identify a variety of 
  materials from plastics to precious gemstones. </font></p>
<p><font size="5" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Raman spectroscopy is totally 
  non-destructive and by using a microscope, spectra can be recorded from very 
  small samples. By using a special attachment on our laser Raman microprobe we 
  can even analyse tiny areas directly on the surface of objects. This picture 
  shows the probe being used to identify the gemstones used to decorate a medieval 
  reliquary.</font></p>
