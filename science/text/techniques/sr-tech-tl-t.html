<h1>Thermoluminescence</h1>
<p> Thermoluminescence, or TL, dating is largely used as a method of determining 
  when pottery was last fired. It is possible because of a property of certain 
  crystalline materials, such as quartz and felspar, which occur naturally in 
  clay. When such crystals are exposed to natural background radiation, from the 
  minute quantities of uranium, potassium and thorium found in all soils, and 
  from cosmic rays, energy from that radiation is transferred into a crystal lattice 
  and trapped there. If the crystals are then heated, this trapped energy escapes 
  in the form of light. Unfired clay from the soil contains a lot of such energy, 
  built up over geological time, but when pottery is fired all energy escapes, 
  zeroing the TL clock. The trapped energy slowly builds up again, at a rate depending 
  on the amount of radiation in the area and length of time since firing. The 
  energy trapped since firing can subsequently be released and measured in the 
  laboratory and the amount used to calculate the time elapsed since the pottery 
  was last fired. </p>
