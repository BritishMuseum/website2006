<h1>Neutron Activation Analysis (NAA)</h1>
<p> This is a popular trace element analysis technique used in archaeology to 
  indicate where things were made (provenance studies) for ceramics, and rocks 
  such as obsidian and marble. A sample is needed from the object to be analysed, 
  usually taken by drilling in an inconspicuous place; about 50 milligrams (one-twentieth 
  of a gram) are sufficient, so the damage to the object is very slight. </p>

<p> When some of this sample is placed in a stream of neutrons, such as in a nuclear 
  reactor, the atoms of the chemical elements of the material capture some of 
  the passing neutrons and are transformed into radioactive versions (isotopes) 
  of the same element, which emit radiation. After the sample has been removed 
  from the reactor it continues to emit radiation as the radioactive isotopes 
  decay, and if placed in front of suitable radiation detectors, the radioactivity 
  of each element can be isolated and is a direct measure of the amount of that 
  element in the material. Standard materials of known composition are irradiated 
  at the same time for calibration purposes. This very sensitive analysis method 
  gives the quantity of over 25 different elements in the object, down to parts 
  per million. </P>
