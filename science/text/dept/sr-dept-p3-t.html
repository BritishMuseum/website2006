<p><font color="#FFFF00">Accurate cataloguing and labelling are crucial components 
  in our ability to give full access to the collections, to both scholarly and 
  general audiences. The Museum therefore prides itself in providing the most 
  accurate and up-to-date information in its exhibitions and catalogues. The material 
  from which an object was made is a critical element of this baseline understanding, 
  and scientific expertise often plays an important part in the provision of this 
  information. Some examples of this work are included on these web pages, see, 
  for example, the pages on <a href="../mosaics/sr-mosaics-p1-t.html">turquoise 
  mosaics</a> from Mexico and <a href="../coffins/sr-coffins-p1-t.html">Egyptian 
  coffins</a>. Radiocarbon dating provides an obvious link between science and 
  the past in the minds of many but, while the Museum had a <a href="../c14/sr-c14-p1-t.html">radiocarbon 
  dating</a> laboratory for nearly half a century (it was one of the first in 
  the country), other, approaches are necessary to determine the date of an object 
  that is made of inorganic material. The compositions of the metal alloys and 
  glasses in use change with time, depending upon how they were produced, and 
  these changes allow us to determine the period when an object or material was 
  made. The techniques used to work gemstones also changed through time, as shown 
  in the pages on Mesopotamian <a href="../seals/sr-seals-p1-t.html">cylinder 
  seals</a>. These types of changes can be very useful in the identification of 
  fakes and forgeries. </font></p>
