    <h2>Are there any dragons in The British 
Museum?</h2>

<P>
      How can such a question be answered in an institution 
the size of the British Museum? Over 250 years of acquisitions has resulted in 
documentation systems centred on hand-written registers, catalogues, index 
cards, excavation/fieldwork reports, and a variety of other documents added to 
and amended by countless scholars over the years. 
    </P>
    <P>
      The development of computers has offered a way through 
this and enabled the Museum to increase the accessibility of its information and 
the collections themselves. The Museum has a database of over 1.5 million 
records for almost 2 million individual objects. By having a standardised method 
of recording the information it is now possible to answer this and other complex 
enquiries.
    </P>
    <P>
      The variation in the styles, levels of detail and 
content of the various sources of written information is overcome by entering 
information such as the name of the object, what it is made of, when and where 
it was made, and who made it. It is possible to search for objects such as 
bronze vessels made in China or Japan in the 18<SUP>th</SUP> Century. 
    </P>
    <P>
      Standardising and controlling information is essential 
to ensure the best possible results are obtained when a user searches the 
database for particular items; for example, the names of artists represented in 
the collections of Prints &amp; Drawings or methods of acquisition. 
    </P>
    <P>
      The Collections Data Management Section has a number of 
thesauri for controlling information, such as what the object is and what it is 
made of , which are adaptable to the enormous range of terms in, for example, 
Ethnography, or to the specificity of some of Medieval and Later's collections. 
These thesauri are being continually updated and expanded as new areas of the 
collections are entered and as new objects are acquired.
    </P>

<P> So, how about the dragons? By searching a variety of fields (2D design, 3D 
  form, materials, subject/iconography and a free-text description) the Museum 
  currently has 2400 references to dragons. These are made of a variety of materials 
  from silver, gold, bronze and iron to ivory, horn, leather, porcelain and earthenware 
  and date from 2300BC - 1997 for cultures and periods as widespread as Assyrian 
  and Babylonian, Anglo-Saxon, Byzantine, Medieval, Mughal, Roman Imperial Period 
  in Egypt, Han and Ming Dynasties in China and the Edo Period in Japan. The objects 
  themselves include, amongst other things, shadow puppets, jewellery, swords, 
  seals, costume, vessels, chess-pieces, figures, finger-rings, prints, drawings, 
  netsuke, masks, door-handles, a "ceramic pillow with dragons and flowers", a 
  "skin bag for Dragon's blood" and, of course, a bowl containing "dragon's blood" 
  (resin from a cinnabar tree!).
