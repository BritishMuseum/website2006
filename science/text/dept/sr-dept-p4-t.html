  Department of Scientific Research: About the Department</FONT></h1>
<p>The skills of the early craftsman, his contacts and markets can be brought 
  to light through an understanding of how an object was made, who made it, and 
  where it was produced. For example, <a href="../sagold/sr-sagold-p1-t.html">pre-Columbian 
  craftsmen in South America</a> used techniques to make jewellery which were 
  quite distinct from those used in Europe. South American people also developed 
  special skills to manufacture their <a href="../whistlepot/sr-whistle-p1-t.html">whistling 
  pots</a>. The examination of <a href="../enamels/sr-enamels-p1t.html">medieval 
  enamels</a> has demonstrated that old Roman glass was re-used to produce the 
  colours, one thousand years after it was made. The techniques of scientific 
  examination can also be applied to the more recent past. For example, microscopy 
  allows us to see how the clockmakers made use of the advances in steelmaking 
  in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries to improve their <a href="../clocks/sr-clocks-p1-t.html">clocks 
  and watches</a>. The work of the department also includes the examination of 
  <a href="../fishbone/sr-fish-p1-t.html">biological material from excavations</a>, 
  to evaluate ancient diets and environments, as well as the assessment of <a href="../treasure/sr-treasure-p1-t.html">treasure</a> 
  from discoveries throughout England. </p>
<p>It ranges across the collections, and demonstrates the great ingenuity and 
  diversity of human behaviour, as well as underlying common themes. </p>
