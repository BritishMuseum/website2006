<h1 >Optical Microscopy</h1>
<p> <img src="../../images/ca283a.gif" align="left" alt="Image of Optical Microscope"> 
<p> The use of optical lenses to enlarge the image of the object allows a wealth 
  of information to be obtained. From the single lens magnifying glass through 
  to more complex optical microscopes, visual examination enables materials and 
  surface treatments to be identified and characterised. The unprepared surfaces 
  of objects can show details of colour, surface pattern and texture, tool marks, 
  joins, repairs, wear, surface coatings, manufacture, corrosion attack and inscriptions. 
<p> Finer details, especially of metals, are observed by the examination of polished 
  sections, using a reflected light microscope. The preparation of these polished 
  sections may involve polishing a small area of the object itself (taper section) 
  or removing a fragment, mounting it in a resin block and then polishing and 
  etching the surface of the block and sample together. </p>
<img src="../../images/caa204.gif" align="left"alt="Image of Thin section of pottery sherd"> 
<p> Stones and ceramics often reveal more information when light is passed though 
  a very thin section, rather than being reflected from the surface. Thin sections 
  of ceramics and stones are made by mounting a small fragment of the material 
  on a glass slide and then grinding and polishing it until it is only 0.03 mm 
  thick, thin enough to allow light to pass easily through. The thin sections 
  are examined using a polarising microscope, allowing the observation of textural 
  characteristics, and the identification of individual mineral grains from their 
  optical properties. Thin sections of organic materials, particularly wood, are 
  made in a similar way and examined microscopically to recognise characteristic 
  cell anatomy, which enables the plant or tree to be identified. </p>
