<h1>Metal Microstructure</h1>
<p> We can look at the microstructure of an ancient metal object to find out how 
  it was made. It is usually too small to be seen with the naked eye, but if prepared 
  properly, can be clearly seen with a Microscope. </p>
<img src="../../images/cd2839.jpg" width="250" alt="Image of Microstructure of cast silver alloy" align="right"> 
<p> Metal is cast by heating it until it melts, then pouring it into a mould. 
  As it cools, tiny crystals grow in the liquid and form a special microstructure. 
  The crystals form branching shapes, called <EM>dentrites</EM>, like those in 
  the photograph. The photograph was taken in a scanning electron microscope and 
  shows an area only half a millimetre across. </p>

<p> If a solid lump of metal is hammered, to shape it into a piece of jewellery 
  for example, the microstructure is deformed. The metal soon becomes hard and 
  can take no more hammering without cracks appearing. To overcome this the metal 
  has to be heated before it can be hammered more. This heating and hammering 
  process is repeated when a goldsmith shapes an object. It causes the dendrites 
  to recrystallise, losing their branching shapes. Heavy hammering causes a banded 
  effect to occur, as shown here. </p>
