<h1>How did they do it?</h1>
<p> Did the Romans realise that they could make red glass using gold? Only a few 
  examples of Roman glass, coloured by gold are known. Usually they made red glass 
  using copper, but this was nearly always opaque. Roman glass makers were used 
  to adding scrap metal and slag to colour their glass. The glass of the Lycurgus 
  Cup may therefore have been made by an accident, which was difficult to repeat. 
  Perhaps the glassmaker did not know that the ingredient he had added contained 
  silver and gold. </P>

<img src="../../images/cc596.gif" alt="Image of the same piece of glass in a different light now looks black"> 
<p> The fragment of glass seen here changes colour in a similar way but the colours 
  are less impressive. This may have been an attempt to reproduce the Lycurgus 
  Cup effect that did not work. </p>
