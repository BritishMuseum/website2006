<h1>Treasure and the Department of Scientific Research</h1>
<p>In ancient times, any treasure found usually ended up becoming the property 
  of the King! This was because of the law of Treasure Trove, which dates back 
  to at least Richard the Lionheart (1189-1199 AD), and was based on even earlier 
  medieval laws. The new Treasure Law introduced in September 1997 was designed 
  to reward the finders of Treasure and to try and safeguard our own heritage 
  for future generations. </p>

<p> Over the centuries, the old law of Treasure Trove had become very complicated. 
  If a treasure was found there would usually be a Coroner's inquest to decide 
  to whom it belonged. At an inquest many things affecting the outcome of a case 
  had to be considered, including whether a treasure had been lost or deliberately 
  buried, which county it was found in, was it found on a beach between low and 
  high water marks, and even what species of trees were found growing nearby...! 
</p>
<p> The new Treasure Act has simplified matters considerably. Objects found which 
  are over 300 years old and contain more than 10% of gold or silver may be declared 
  to be 'Treasure'. </p>
