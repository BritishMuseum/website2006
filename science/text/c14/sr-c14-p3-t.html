<h1>How Old was the Barnack Burial?</h1>

                alt="Image of C14 apperatus at the British Museum"> By measuring 
  how much <sup>14</sup>C remains in ancient organic materials, it is possible 
  to calculate how long ago they died. To do this requires extensive chemical 
  processing, carried out in laboratories like that of the British Museum, to 
  convert the carbon in the ancient objects to a form in which the very low level 
  radioactivity (way below background levels) can be measured. </P>
<BR CLEAR="ALL">
<p> This is the equipment used to date the bone in the Museum's laboratories. 
  Using this glassware we extracted some of the carbon from the man's leg and 
  measured the amount of radioactivity it contained. From this, using radiocarbon 
  dating, we were able to tell that the man died between 2330 and 2130 BC, or 
  just over 4000 years ago, at a time when pyramids were still being built in 
  Egypt. </p>
<br clear="all">
<img src="../../images/3(c14).gif" alt="Image of organic materials can be used for radiocarbon dating if they are able to survive long periods of time"> 
<P> Most radiocarbon dating is carried out on bone or charcoal, as these are the 
  organics that most frequently survive from the past, but many other materials, 
  like the ancient Egyptian rope, mummy wrappings and reeds shown here, can also 
  be dated using this technique. </p>
