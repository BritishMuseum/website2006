<h1>How Old was the Barnack Burial?</h1>
<img src="../../images/barnack.gif" alt="Image of A reconstruction of a grave from Barnack, Liconshire,England"> 
<p> This picture shows a reconstruction of an ancient grave usually displayed 
  in the Prehistoric galleries of the Museum. The original burial was of an adult 
  man, found at Barnack in Lincolnshire. One of the first questions about such 
  a discovery is how old it is. </p>
<p> The objects found in the grave give us the first clues about its date. The 
  pot is a very unusual shape. Archaeologists call these pots "Beakers", and they 
  have been found in similar graves all over Europe. The metal object on the man's 
  wrist is an archer's wrist guard. This shows that he used a bow and arrow. The 
  guard was to stop the bowstring bruising his arm every time he fired an arrow. 
  It is also a special shape, which is typical of the beaker period. Altogether, 
  the shape of the grave, and the things in it, tell us that this man lived in 
  the Beaker period, the earliest part of the <a href="../glossary/sr-glossary-time_ba.html">British 
  Bronze Age</a>. But this still doesn't tell us exactly when this was. </p>
<p> By using science, and a process called <a href = "sr-c14-radio-t.html"> radiocarbon 
  dating</a>, we can find out just how long ago this man died. To do this we need 
  to use part of a bone from the burial. </p>
