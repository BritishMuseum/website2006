<h1>Radiocarbon Dating</h1>
<!--end of title--> <!--rest of text--> </FONT><FONT FACE="Arial, helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="5">
<p> One of the most important questions asked about any ancient object is just 
  how old it really is. There are a number of scientific techniques which can 
  be used to date antiquities, but probably the best known and most frequently 
  used is radiocarbon or <sup>14</sup>C dating. Radiocarbon dating can only be 
  applied to organisms that were once alive and is a means of determining how 
  long ago they died. </p>
<img src="../../images/c14pica.gif" alt="The C14 process"> 
<p> Radiocarbon dating is possible because of the existence in nature of a tiny 
  amount of <sup>14</sup>C, or radiocarbon, a radioactive isotope of carbon. This 
  isotope is produced in the upper atmosphere by the action of cosmic rays on 
  <sup>14</sup>N. This <sup>14</sup>C combines with oxygen to produce carbon dioxide 
  (CO<sub>2</sub>) and is taken in by plants during photosynthesis. From plants 
  this <sup>14</sup>C is absorbed into the tissues of every living thing via the 
  food chain. Since it is radioactive, it is unstable and decays away at a known 
  rate. While any plant or animal is alive the <sup>14</sup>C lost by radioactive 
  decay is constantly replaced through the food chain, but when that organism 
  dies, no more <sup>14</sup>C is taken in, and the amount present in the tissues 
  goes down. </p>
<p> <img src="../../images/ca288.gif"  align="RIGHT" 
                alt="C14 apperatus at the British Museum"> By measuring how much 
  <sup>14</sup>C remains in ancient organic materials, it is possible to calculate 
  how long ago they died. To do this requires extensive chemical processing, carried 
  out in laboratories like that of the British Museum To convert the carbon in 
  the ancient objects to a form in which the very low level radioactivity (way 
  below background levels) can be measured. </P>
<BR CLEAR="ALL">
<img src="../../images/3(c14).gif" alt="Examples of Organic materials that can be dated by radiocarbon dating if they can survive long enough"> 
<P> Most radiocarbon dating is carried out on bone or charcoal, as these are the 
  organics that most frequently survive from the past, but many other materials, 
  like the ancient Egyptian rope, mummy wrappings and reeds shown here, can also 
  be dated using this technique. </p>
