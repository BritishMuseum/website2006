<p><font color="#00FFFF" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="5">Designed 
  by Foster and Partners, The Great Court is the British Museum's exciting and 
  imaginative development of Sir Robert Smirke's imposing inner courtyard, completed 
  around 1850 but never used by the visiting public. After a few years the Reading 
  Room was built at its centre, the surrounding areas becoming clogged with bookstacks, 
  outbuildings and storage. For nearly 150 years, the courtyard was forgotten 
  and neglected, one of the great hidden spaces of London. As part of the Great 
  Court,The British Museum's magnificent South Portico is an entirely new construction 
  in fresh stone. 65 feet high, it differs from the original (demolished in 1877 
  to make way for an extension of the Front Hall) in that it has three portals 
  to allow entrance to the Great Court for large numbers of visitors, and houses 
  lifts providing access to the upper floor. </font></p>
<p><font color="#00FFFF" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="5">The South 
  Portico has become controversial because the contractor chose to deceive the 
  Project Team by supplying as Portland a French oolitic limestone possessing 
  very similar characteristics.With full regard to professional advice the building 
  proceeded. The lighter appearance of the Portico compared to the adjacent weathered 
  stonework is to be expected irrespective of the type of fresh stone employed. 
  Pressure washing soon to be undertaken will remove impacted dust from the pores 
  of the stone, a process which will mellow its hue. </font></p>

  Court opened to the public on 7 December 2000. We would like to hear your views
