<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="5" color="#00FFFF">On 7 December 
  2000, the Queen Elizabeth II Great Court, at the heart of The British Museum, 
  opened to the public.</font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="5" color="#00FFFF">The 
  two-acre square, enclosed by a spectacular glass roof, has transformed the Museum's 
  inner courtyard, with the world-famous Reading Room at its centre, into the 
  largest covered public square in Europe. <br>
  Designed by Foster and Partners, the £100 million project has been supported 
  by grants of £30 million from the Millennium Commission and £15.75 million from 
  the Heritage Lottery Fund.<br>
  <br wp="BR1">
  The courtyard was one of the lost spaces of London, hidden from public view 
  since 1857. The relocation and opening of the British Library at its St Pancras 
  site, has enabled valuable space within the Museum to be utilised to the benefit 
  of the Museum's visitors. The Great Court increases public space in the Museum 
  by forty per cent, allowing visitors to move freely around the Main floor for 
  the first time in 150 years. Once in the Great Court, visitors can choose from 
  a number points of entry into the galleries. There is direct access west into 
  the Egyptian Sculpture Gallery, east into the King's Library and north into 
  the new Wellcome Gallery of Ethnography. Inside the courtyard itself, two monumental 
  staircases encircle the drum of the Reading Room and lead to the Joseph Hotung 
  Great Court Gallery, and the Court Restaurant. From the restaurant level a bridge 
  link takes visitors into the upper galleries of the Museum</font><font color="#00FFFF" size="5">.

<p><font size="5" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#00FFFF"><b><font color="#00FF00">Glass 
  Roof and South Portico </font></b><br>
  <br>
  </font><font size="5" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#00FFFF">As 
  part of the Great Court project, the 1870s extension to the Museum's Weston 
  Great Hall has been removed and a new southern portico has been reinstated using 
  over 1,000 tonnes of stone.</font></p>
<p><font size="5" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#00FFFF"> As well 
  as housing lifts providing access to the upper floor, <a href="sptext.html">the 
  new South portico</a> has three large portals through which the majority of 
  visitors gain their first view of the Great Court.</font></p>
<p><font size="5" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#00FFFF">Integral 
  to the project on the South side of the site is the re-landscaping of the Museum 
  forecourt to provide a fitting threshold to the refurbished Weston Great Hall 
  and the Great Court. The Museum's Montague Place entrance has been similarly 
  enhanced by the reinstatement of the railings removed at the time of the Second 
  World War. Faithful copies of the original cast iron gates and railings were 
  specially commisioned and now create an impressive feature on the north side 
  of the Museum This sequence of linked spaces forms an important part of a new 
  cultural route from the British Library at St Pancras to Covent Garden.</font><font color="#00FFFF" size="5"><br>
  <br>
  <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The Great Court's magnificent glass 
  and steel roof was designed by computer. Work on the roof began in September 
  1999, and the 478-tonne steel structure, which supports 315 tonnes of glass 
  has been built like a giant jigsaw puzzle. The installation of the glass panels 
  was completed in July . The 11kms of roof structure has been built to an astonishing 
  accuracy of 3mms.</font></font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="5" color="#00FFFF"><b><font color="#00FF00">The 
  Round Reading Room </font></b></font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="5" color="#00FFFF">At the heart 
  of the Great Court is the magnificent Reading Room. When completed in 1857, 
  it was immediately hailed as one of the great sights of London. Despite being 
  amongst the most famous rooms in the world, it has only been generally accessible 
  to those with a Reader's ticket. its opening to the public on December 7, begins 
  a new chapter in its distinguished history and is for the first time, available 
  to all Museum visitors. Its magnificent interior has been carefully restored, 
  including the repair of the papier m&acirc;ch&eacute; interior of the dome and 
  reinstatement of the 1857 azure-blue, cream and gold decorative scheme devised 
  by Sydney Smirke.It houses the Paul Hamlyn Library, a new public reference resource 
  library of some 25,000 books, catalogues and other printed material focusing 
  on the world cultures represented in The British Museum.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="5" color="#00FFFF">Complementing 
  the library and part of the Walter and Leonore Annenberg centre within the Reading 
  Room, is COMPASS, a multi-media public access system, which offers a multitude 
  of possibilities for exploring the Museum's collections and enables users to 
  gain a fuller understanding of objects and their context. Both the Paul Hamlyn 
  Library and the Annenberg Centre's COMPASS facilities are conceived as new public 
  resources for those who wish to explore the Museum's collections in new ways. 
  Together they bridge the gap between the general enquiry services offered by 
  the Information desks and the specialist research facilities of the Student's 
  Rooms. High quality image printing and photocopying services will be available 
  for visitors.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="5" color="#CCCCCC"><b><font color="#00FF00">Clore 
  Education Centre</font></b></font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="5" color="#00FFFF">Housed in 
  the newly created lower level of the Great Court, the Clore Education Centre 
  comprises the BP Lecture Theatre; the Hugh and Catherine Stevenson Theatre; 
  the Raymond and Beverley Sackler Seminar Room; the Studio, used for art and 
  craft activities; the Claus Moser seminar roomand the Ford Centre for Young 
  Visitors. The Clore Education Centre will enable the Museum to expand its educational 
  role in many new directions. Its two auditoria are home to a daily programme 
  of lectures, film and videos, as well as conferences, concerts and other performances 
  related to cultural festivals or special exhibitions. Five additional multi-purpose 
  rooms are used for other programmes ranging from informal drop-in' sessions 
  to courses for the general public and teacher training.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="5" color="#00FFFF">The Young 
  Visitor Centre provides dedicated facilities and a range of tailor-made educational 
  programmes for the hundreds of thousands of young people who visit annually 
  in school and college groups. At weekends and during school holidays these areas 
  will be used for family and community events.</font> </p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="5" color="#00FFFF"><b><font color="#00FF00">New 
  Galleries</font></b></font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="5" color="#00FFFF">The Great 
  Court will also encompass new permenant gallery space. In 1970, The British 
  Museum's Department of Ethnography was moved to the Museum of Mankind off Piccadilly 
  because of the lack of space at Bloomsbury. Since then the collections have 
  been displayed in a series of temporary exhibitions. As a major part of the 
  Museum's development plans, the Ethnography collections are being brought back 
  to Bloomsbury to be displayed in new permanent galleries in the Great Court 
  (Sainsbury African Galleries). The return of the Ethnography collections is 
  of vital importance to the Museum's aim of portraying a complete picture of 
  human achievement and will enable the works of recent non-western societies 
  to be seen in their proper context among other world cultures, past and present. 
  An important element of the Sainsbury Galleries is a dedicated area for changing 
  displays, focusing particularly on contemporary works. The Sainsbury African 
  Galleries link to planned new galleries for American, Asian, European and Pacific 
  cultures on the north side of the museum.</font></p>
<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="5" color="#00FFFF">The Joseph 
Hotung Great Court Gallery is the Museum's major new space for temporary exhibitions, 
inaugurated by Human Image (7 December 2000- 11 February 2001). This is an ambitious 
and comprehensive examination of representations of the human form drawn from 
across the entire range of the Museum's collections. Life-size works form the 
focal point of the exhibition, ranging from Africa to the Far East, and Ancient 
Greece to the Americas.<br wp="BR1">

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="5" color="#00FFFF"><b><font color="#00FF00">Opening 
  times</font></b></font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="5" color="#00FFFF"> The Great 
  Court will provide The British Museum with a well equipped building for the 
  six million visitors it receives each year and will offer these visitors an 
  excellent standard of visitor service. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="5" color="#00FFFF"> The Great 
  Court's extended opening hours (see below) will enable the Museum to develop 
  new audiences, including those living and working locally. During the evening, 
  visitors will be able to attend a lecture, film or concert in the Clore Education 
  Centre, view a special exhibition in the Joseph Hotung Great Court Gallery, 
  expand their understanding of collections in the Reading Room, enjoy a meal 
  in the Court Restaurant or simply relax with friends in the caf&eacute; areas. 
  The Great Court, Europes largest covered public square will inevitably become 
  a new cultural venue for London and a destination attraction in itself.<br wp="BR1">
