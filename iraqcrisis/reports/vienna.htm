                                    This meeting was organised by the University 
                                    of Vienna in conjunction with other academic 
                                    bodies in Austria. While the majority of the 
                                    participants were from Austria there were 
                                    a number of speakers from Germany, the US 
                                    etc. The Iraqi participants were Dr Mu&#8217;ayyad 
                                    Damerji (Iraq Culture Cabinet), Dr Nawalla 
                                    Mutawali (Director of the Iraq Museum) and 
                                    Dr Abdullilah Fadhil (Head of the Department 
                                    of Archaeology at Baghdad University). Summaries 
                                    of the papers are being prepared by the delegates 
                                    and will be posted on the University of Vienna&#8217;s 
                                    website shortly. In addition to the papers, 
                                    there were films showing the state of the 
                                    Baghdad museum and destroyed buildings in 
                                    Baghdad such as the University, looted sites, 
                                    and a disturbing film by a German team seeking 
                                    to find out how easy it was to buy the looted 
                                    antiquities which are freely available and 
                                    with a market price known to the dealers.<br>
                                    <br>
                                    The following report by Venetia Porter (Department 
                                    of Asia, British Museum) will only discuss 
                                    questions to her paper which she felt were 
                                    relevant and the result of informal discussions 
                                    with colleagues. She and Nigel Pittman (Department 
                                    of Culture, Media and Sport) were the only 
                                    participants from the UK.<br>

                                    <strong>The looting of antiquities and the 
                                    role of museums.</strong><br>
                                    <br>
                                    Much of the discussion on my presentation 
                                    came in the form of a question from David 
                                    Nelson Gimpel (Archaeos) questioning the role 
                                    of museums and in his view their implication 
                                    in the smuggling of antiquities. He cited 
                                    in particular the recent example of the exhibition 
                                    at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in which 
                                    unprovenanced material owned by collectors 
                                    was displayed alongside objects from museums. 
                                    He said that by agreeing to display our material 
                                    alongside &#8220;museum&#8221; objects, museums 
                                    were effectively colluding in the trade and 
                                    legitimising it. He also mentioned the role 
                                    of high profile American collectors who legitimised 
                                    their collections of smuggled unprovenanced 
                                    material by making donations to museums etc. 
                                    He strongly urged museums to take a stand 
                                    and not participate in exhibitions in which 
                                    such material was exhibited.<br>
                                    In reply, I said how strict the BM is about 
                                    acquiring unprovenanced material and that 
                                    we only acquire objects that we can prove 
                                    came out before 1970. I also cited the recent 
                                    example of an exhibition in Lisbon on Afghanistan, 
                                    organised by curators from the Mus&eacute;e 
                                    Guimet, Paris, in which the British Museum 
                                    had declined to participate because looted 
                                    objects were to be included.</font></font></p>

                                    <br>
                                    Dr Anna Paolini (head of the Unit for Arab 
                                    countries) was anxious to emphasise that it 
                                    is UNESCO that will be evaluating the offers 
                                    of help that are now coming in at a great 
                                    rate. They particularly want to avoid duplication 
                                    of effort. UNESCO were planning a meeting 
                                    in July in which all the offers would be evaluated. 
                                    It was thought that another mission to Baghdad 
                                    should also be sent to evaluate the needs 
                                    on the ground project by project. She also 
                                    mentioned that it was now envisaged that UNESCO 
                                    official Usam Ghaidan, who was present in 
                                    Vienna, would go out to Baghdad soon to set 
                                    up an office to provide the link on the ground. 
                                    Whether he would be based in the UNDP office 
                                    or elsewhere remained to be established. </font></p>

                                    Abdullilah Fadhil and Dr Mu&#8217;ayyad Damerji&#8217;s 
                                    assessments of the situation and their needs</strong><br>
                                    <br>
                                    Dr Fadhil spoke of the desperate need for 
                                    basic equipment in the University: overhead 
                                    projectors and publications in particular. 
                                    The question of books was discussed more widely. 
                                    At the museum, the need is for post 1990 publications. 
                                    At the University they need everything. Anna 
                                    said that UNESCO could coordinate this. Margareta 
                                    van Ess said that lists were already being 
                                    prepared in Germany and the Frankfurt book 
                                    fair had been approached for help. Arab donors 
                                    would also be contacted for Arabic books. 
                                    Nigel Pittman said that in the UK the Al-Makhtoum 
                                    Institute and Edinburgh University had launched 
                                    appeals. Dr Fadhil and Dr Damerji stressed 
                                    that even if there were several copies of 
                                    books this did not matter as they could go 
                                    outside Baghdad. <br>
                                    <br>
                                    Dr Damerji stressed first of all that he wished 
                                    to see more action resulting from the conferences. 
                                    He emphasised the need for specialists curators/conservators 
                                    and wished to see long lasting effects to 
                                    be achieved as a result of full cooperation. 
                                    UNESCO must urge the countries that have not 
                                    ratified the 2nd Hague protocol (which included 
                                    UK, US and Germany) to do so. He urged that 
                                    the coalition re-open the Iraq Museum as soon 
                                    as possible, that the foreign Schools and 
                                    Institutes return and that for the excavations 
                                    they use Iraqi expertise including retired 
                                    Iraqi archaeologists. He said that Iraq had 
                                    huge potential for cultural and religious 
                                    tourism which had yet to be exploited, and 
                                    that the preservation of the sites was crucial

                                    The question of the guarding of sites was 
                                    discussed in some detail. At present for the 
                                    10,000 sites there are 1,600 guards. One difficulty 
                                    is that the guards are not allowed to carry 
                                    arms and there are not nearly enough of tem. 
                                    He felt that in order to secure the long term 
                                    safety and stability of the sites, they had 
                                    to use the Wasit example. Here, they had brought 
                                    in a family and given them land, thus securing 
                                    their loyalty, and had secured the site. He 
                                    also emphasised that it was up to individual 
                                    foreign teams to ensure loyalty, as had been 
                                    done by Dr Trenkwalder who had helped villagers 
                                    in various ways.<br>
