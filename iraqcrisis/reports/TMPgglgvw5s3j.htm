                                    Thursday evening with a reception and buffet 
                                    supper in the &#8220;Apollon&#8221; room of 
                                    the Hotel Nikko. The speeches of welcome included 
                                    one by Ms Atsuko Toyama, the Japanese Minister 
                                    of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and 
                                    Technology. <br>

                                    The meeting on Friday 1 August was in the 
                                    International Conference Room of the Plaza 
                                    Heisi, a short bus ride away from the Hotel 
                                    Nikko. The conference was opened by Professor 
                                    Ikuo Hirayama. He told us that he had first 
                                    visited Iraq in 1969, and in 1973 he had organised 
                                    an exhibition of paintings from Silk Road 
                                    countries including Iraq. He stressed the 
                                    contributions of Iraq to the civilisation 
                                    of the world. He reminded us that the cultural 
                                    heritage of Japan had been greatly damaged 
                                    in World War II, and since then he had been 
                                    committed to helping other countries with 
                                    comparable problems, namely Afghanistan, Cambodia 
                                    and now Iraq. He envisaged a sort of &#8220;cultural 
                                    red cross&#8221; which could come to the aid 
                                    of those countries in need. Mr Matsuura (speech 
                                    circulated) described the two previous UNESCO 
                                    conferences on this subject, in Paris and 
                                    London, and the two UNESCO missions to Iraq, 
                                    and outlined the difficulties there had been 
                                    in arranging these missions, particularly 
                                    the first. He spoke of his regret that until 
                                    recently there was only one World Heritage 
                                    site in Iraq, namely Hatra, but was pleased 
                                    that it had now been possible to add Assur 
                                    to the list. He outlined the priorities for 
                                    UNESCO with regard to the Iraq crisis, namely 
                                    encouraging all countries to sign up to Resolution 
                                    1483, co-ordinating all offers of help, and 
                                    arranging for protection of archaeological 
                                    sites. For the latter, UNESCO was advocating 
                                    the introduction of &#8220;cultural police&#8221;. 
                                    Ms Toyama, who was supposed also to give an 
                                    opening address, was delayed by urgent parliamentary 
                                    business and had to deliver her speech later 
                                    in the morning. Keynote addresses were given 
                                    by Muayyad Damerji, MacGuire Gibson, John 
                                    Curtis and Jabr Ibrahim Khalil. Dr Damerji 
                                    stressed the great contribution of Iraq to 
                                    the cultural heritage of the world, and reminded 
                                    the delegates that there were more than 10,000 
                                    registered sites in Iraq and more than 30 
                                    museums. He thanked UNESCO for its quick initiative 
                                    and Ambassador Cordone for his fruitful co-operation 
                                    with the newly-created Cultural Ministry. 
                                    Professor Gibson recalled that he had provided 
                                    the Pentagon with a list of over 5,000 sites 
                                    and monuments in late January, and in early 
                                    March he had published an article in Science 
                                    reviewing the threat to the Iraqi cultural 
                                    heritage and outlining the damage already 
                                    done to it by sanctions. He made an eloquent 
                                    and emotive plea for the protection of archaeological 
                                    sites and for measures to halt the trade in 
                                    antiquities. He explained that a bill currently 
                                    before the two Houses of Congress in the US 
                                    would make it illegal to trade in Iraqi antiquities. 
                                    Dr Curtis (Department of the Ancient Near 
                                    East, British Museum) described his two visits 
                                    to Iraq since the end of the war including 
                                    the work of the British Museum mission 11 
                                    &#8211; 26 June, and the conservation proposals 
                                    which had arisen from that. These were to 
                                    bring a team of 4 Iraqi conservators to the 
                                    British Museum for top-up training in the 
                                    period August-September 2003, and to send 
                                    an international team of 6-8 conservators 
                                    out to Iraq in the autumn (October-December 
                                    2003). Dr Jabr thanked UNESCO for organising 
                                    this international meeting and the government 
                                    of Japan for sponsoring it, and urged that 
                                    more such meetings should be organised to 
                                    discuss the restoration of the cultural heritage 
                                    of Iraq.<br>
                                    <br>
                                    The first session of the afternoon was dedicated 
                                    to &#8220;short-term and long-term actions 
                                    for the Iraq Museum of Baghdad&#8221;, with 
                                    Dr Jabr Ibrahim acting as moderator. Dr Nawala 
                                    said that at least 13,000 objects had been 
                                    stolen mostly from eight large storerooms. 
                                    The stolen objects were of pottery, glass 
                                    and ivory, as well as beads. The looters not 
                                    only stole objects, but also threw them on 
                                    the floor and damaged or destroyed them. She 
                                    described how an inventory of the stolen objects 
                                    had been underway since the end of the looting, 
                                    but initially it had been hampered by the 
                                    adverse security situation and the difficulties 
                                    encountered by staff in getting to the museum. 
                                    She was grateful to the first UNESCO mission 
                                    and to Mr Bouchenaki who had organised a bus 
                                    shuttle to enable the staff to get to work. 
                                    Some air conditioning had also been repaired, 
                                    making it possible to work in the storerooms. 
                                    Offices and laboratory areas had also been 
                                    plundered, but fortunately the museum registers 
                                    and card indices were safe. The Children&#8217;s 
                                    Museum had been badly damaged. The pieces 
                                    stored in the Central Bank, including the 
                                    Nimrud treasures, were now known to be safe. 
                                    Professor Shigeo Aoki (Director of the Department 
                                    of Restoration Techniques, Tokyo) concentrated 
                                    on conservation needs. He described the present 
                                    conservation facilities in the museum, spread 
                                    over 11 rooms, and stressed the need for a 
                                    restoration &#8220;road map&#8221; that would 
                                    take account of health and fire safety needs. 
                                    It was important that records should be kept 
                                    of all conservation work undertaken. Amongst 
                                    the difficulties facing conservators were 
                                    the facts that in the storeroom temperatures 
                                    could go above 50oC without air conditioning, 
                                    which might cause adhesives and resins to 
                                    melt, and the &#8220;new&#8221; storerooms 
                                    were damp, caused by the high ground water 
                                    level. In the following debate, Dr Donbaz 
                                    stated that the Turkish government was ready 
                                    to crack down on the illicit trade in Iraqi 
                                    antiquities. There was already a long tradition 
                                    in Turkey for this sort of action, as before 
                                    the First World War the Ottoman government 
                                    had taken its responsibility for looking after 
                                    the Iraqi cultural heritage very seriously. 
                                    Dr Daoulatli (ICCROM) suggested that the Regional 
                                    Training Centre for the Restoration of Cultural 
                                    Heritage in Baghdad should be restored and 
                                    made use of. Mr Petzet (ICOMOS) reported that 
                                    ICOMOS had sent a mission comprising Greek 
                                    colleagues to Baghdad in mid-June. They had 
                                    come away with a negative impression of the 
                                    situation and the possibilities; it was important 
                                    now to be positive and constructive. Mr Bouchenaki 
                                    stressed the importance of co-operation, and 
                                    how UNESCO could play a role here. There had 
                                    been offers from both Italy and Japan to fit 
                                    out a new laboratory. UNESCO had brought both 
                                    parties together yesterday evening, to very 
                                    good effect: a unique list of equipment based 
                                    on the two offers would now be drawn up. Professor 
                                    Matsumoto demanded that UNESCO should be more 
                                    proactive in helping to retrieve the looted 
                                    artefacts, to which Mr Bouchenaki responded 
                                    by listing the initiatives already undertaken 
                                    by UNESCO, and Dr Grattan questioned whether 
                                    the British Museum should be drawing up a 
                                    conservation plan. He stressed that any plan 
                                    should be drawn up under the auspices of UNESCO, 
                                    involving ICOMOS, ICCROM and ICOM. There were 
                                    further contributions from Mr Hayao Kawai 
                                    (Commissioner for Cultural Affairs, Japan), 
                                    Mr Hiroshi Nozaki (Director of the National

                                    <br>
                                    1. UNESCO should ensure that the Iraq Museum 
                                    laboratories are refurbished and re-equipped 
                                    immediately.<br>
                                    2. UNESCO should immediately provide the Iraq 
                                    Museum with a security system to protect the 
                                    building and its collections.<br>
                                    3. UNESCO should draw up a conservation plan 
                                    for the Iraq Museum, taking account of the 
                                    work already carried out by the British Museum.<br>
                                    4. Immediate measures should be taken to stabilise 
                                    the ivories at risk.<br>
                                    5. UNESCO should set up a long-term conservation 
                                    training programme in co-operation with ICOM, 
                                    ICOMOS and ICCROM.<span class="med"><br>

                                    After a break for tea, the third session concentrated 
                                    on &#8220;Measures for the Protection of the 
                                    Iraqi Cultural Heritage&#8221;, with Mr Bouchenaki 
                                    acting as moderator. Films of the UNESCO missions 
                                    to Iraq were shown by Mr Bouchenaki himself 
                                    and Professor Matsumoto. The latter film of 
                                    the second UNESCO mission highlighted the 
                                    damage in Basra, to the Central Library which 
                                    was completely burnt out, to the Islamic Library 
                                    (established in 1950) which was looted and 
                                    occupied by squatters, and to the Natural 
                                    History Museum and the library of Basra University, 
                                    both of which were looted. Dr Jabr Ibrahim 
                                    described the damage to various historical 
                                    buildings including the Abbasid Palace, Bab 
                                    el Wastani, and Qushla. Although the damage 
                                    to the Iraq Museum was severe, it was very 
                                    lucky that it had not been burnt down. If 
                                    this had happened, the whole cultural heritage 
                                    of Iraq would have been at risk. In this context, 
                                    Dr Jabr told us of an Arabic proverb: &#8220;When 
                                    the mother dies, the house dies&#8221;. Dr 
                                    Damerji focused on cultural centres in Baghdad 
                                    apart from the Iraq Museum. He told us that 
                                    in the two modern art galleries, of more than 
                                    4000 paintings only 200 had been saved, while 
                                    sculptures were standing in sewer water. The 
                                    National Centre for Archives and Documentation 
                                    covering the Ottoman period and the 20th century 
                                    up to 1963 had been mostly destroyed, and 
                                    the Ministry of Religious Affairs (Al-Qawf 
                                    Library?) had been extensively damaged. Other 
                                    cultural institutions that had been looted 
                                    included the School of Music and Ballet, the 
                                    Institute of Traditional Music and Melodies, 
                                    the Children&#8217;s Library, the Children&#8217;s 
                                    Museum, the Rashid Theatre, the National Theatre, 
                                    and the House for Folklore Arts. He stressed 
                                    that thought should be given to the intangible 
                                    heritage of Iraq, i.e. music, poetry and folklore. 
                                    Dr Parapetti pointed out that when restoring 
                                    historic sites it should be remembered that 
                                    some, such as Babylon and Samarra, had been 
                                    exploited for political reasons, contrary 
                                    to the spirit of the Nara declaration. Dr 
                                    van Ess made 3 interesting suggestions: (i) 
                                    foreign missions should take responsibility 
                                    for sites and stop looting by paying guards; 
                                    (ii) it would be better not to restart excavations 
                                    at the present time but concentrate on surveys; 
                                    (iii) priority should be given to the stabilisation 
                                    and conservation of excavated architecture. 
                                    Dr Daoulatli (now speaking on behalf of ALECSO) 
                                    said that Arab countries were very concerned 
                                    about the large number of meetings which had 
                                    been held and the various missions to Iraq 
                                    which had been organised in connection with 
                                    the crisis. They believed it was essential 
                                    that an international co-ordinating body should 
                                    be established as was done for example in 
                                    Cambodia and Afghanistan. There were further 
                                    contributions from Dr al-Radi, Bonnie Magness-Gardiner, 
                                    Jean-Marie Arnault, Michael Petzet and Professor 
                                    Masaaki Sawada. <br>

                                    There then followed some general discussion 
                                    which led to some <br>

                                    1. The Director-General of UNESCO should establish
