                                  The main focus of The British Museum assistance 
                                  to Iraq is on conservation issues but we are 
                                  also in a position to offer curatorial expertise. 
                                  However, due to the lack of flights and the 
                                  difficult security circumstances there are many 
                                  problems involved in actually getting to Baghdad 
                                  and being able to stay there safely in order 
                                  to help. One way that it was possible was to 
                                  be seconded via the British Foreign Office to 
                                  work with the CPA (Coalition Provisional Authority). 
                                  In May three members of the Ancient Near East 
                                  department &#8211; John Curtis, Dominique Collon 
                                  and myself &#8211; attended a training course 
                                  at the RTMC (Reserves Training and Mobilisation 
                                  Centre) at Chilwell. This training was required 
                                  for those being seconded to the CPA and involved 
                                  learning about the dangers which might be encountered 
                                  in Iraq, having a medical assessment and inoculations 
                                  and being given a huge kit bag full of protective 
                                  gear such as flak jacket, helmet and gas mask. 
                                  Helen McDonald of the British School of Archaeology 
                                  in Iraq also attended this course and a few 
                                  weeks later on 6 June Helen and I travelled 
                                  to Baghdad with the British military. It took 
                                  us two days to get there as it involved stops 
                                  at military bases in Germany, Cyprus and Kuwait 
                                  and involved flying in different military planes. 
                                  Both of us had worked on excavations in Iraq 
                                  before 1990 and in Baghdad at the BSAI. We have 
                                  also both spent a considerable amount of time 
                                  working in various other countries in the Middle 
                                  East however, this time we were in rather different 
                                  circumstances than we had encountered before. 
                                  <br>
                                  We were assigned to work as advisors to the 
                                  CPA Ministry of Culture which as well as archaeology, 
                                  museums and heritage is also responsible for 
                                  the arts, music, theatre and cinema and tourism. 
                                  Although I did become involved with helping 
                                  with other aspects of culture, such as libraries 
                                  and art, the majority of what I did there was 
                                  related to the museums and archaeological sites 
                                  issues. Each CPA ministry is headed by a senior 
                                  advisor with a varied number of civilian advisors 
                                  and US military and each ministry works with 
                                  its Iraqi counterparts to try to restore conditions 
                                  in the country. The headquarters of the CPA 
                                  is situated in one of Saddam Hussein&#8217;s 
                                  palaces in Baghdad. It is vast and richly decorated 
                                  with marble floors, decorative wall panels and 
                                  lots of chandeliers. At the beginning of our 
                                  time there most people were living and working 
                                  in the palace under very difficult conditions. 
                                  It was crowded with hundreds of people, both 
                                  military and civilians, doing widely different 
                                  jobs and working day and night in rooms, corridors 
                                  and even bathrooms. It was very hot with no 
                                  running water and there were problems with electricity 
                                  and communications. The CPA have taken over 
                                  some other buildings too and created a patrolled 
                                  security zone around the palace and these buildings. 
                                  Helen and I were put into a hotel which they 
                                  have taken over within this zone. It was in 
                                  a bad state and had been looted; however, there 
                                  were improvements being made all the time and 
                                  by the time I left the living and working conditions 
                                  were much better. <br>
                                  <br>
                                  Helen and I worked together in Baghdad for the 
                                  first two weeks and then she went to work with 
                                  the CPA at Babylon as there was a need for an 
                                  archaeologist to be based there. A big problem 
                                  affecting the archaeology of Iraq, especially 
                                  in the south, is the looting of the archaeological 
                                  sites. It is not possible in the present circumstances 
                                  in Iraq for cultural affairs to be high on the 
                                  list of priorities for the military and they 
                                  do not have the manpower to patrol the hundreds 
                                  of archaeological sites. Helen and I were involved 
                                  in trying to do something about this problem 
                                  but progress was frustratingly slow. Initially 
                                  it was very difficult to get information about 
                                  the situation regarding which sites were being 
                                  looted and when, as it is a constantly changing 
                                  situation. Organising visits to sites was complicated 
                                  and discouraged because travelling to some areas 
                                  was still rather dangerous. Site guards were 
                                  actually being employed but many were being 
                                  frightened away by the looters who are often 
                                  armed. There have been some improvements in 
                                  the looting situation particularly in the area 
                                  of Nassiriyah where the Italian carabinieri, 
                                  who were stationed there in August, carried 
                                  out some patrols of sites and were deterring 
                                  looters but this is a temporary solution and 
                                  something more permanent is necessary. One of 
                                  the things that needs to happen is for guards 
                                  to have vehicles as well as a communication 
                                  system with contact with the local police station. 
                                  This was something that was being negotiated 
                                  while I was there and I am hopeful will happen 
                                  eventually. <br>
                                  <br>
                                  Most of my mornings were spent at the Iraq Museum 
                                  and at the offices of the Department of Antiquities 
                                  which are in the same building. I needed to 
                                  travel to the museum every day which was not 
                                  easy to organise and sometimes involved travelling 
                                  in military vehicles wearing body armour and 
                                  at other times travelling in a more normal fashion 
                                  with Iraq museum staff. <br>
                                  <br>
                                  There have been numerous reports in the press 
                                  about the extent of the looting of the Iraq 
                                  Museum, how it happened and who may have been 
                                  responsible. During the months that I was there 
                                  journalists were still appearing almost every 
                                  day wanting to find out the &#8220;real&#8221; 
                                  story. An obsession with numbers has led to 
                                  reports of many differing amounts of looted 
                                  items. The Iraq Museum has a vast collection 
                                  of material and there are storage areas not 
                                  just in the museum but elsewhere as well. The 
                                  museum staff had taken the precaution of moving 
                                  most of the objects from the exhibition galleries 
                                  and putting them into storerooms except for 
                                  some of the larger items and those which were 
                                  difficult to move. Some of these well-known 
                                  objects were stolen from the galleries and several 
                                  of the storerooms were looted. It has not yet 
                                  been possible for staff to work in the storerooms 
                                  due to problems with electricity and lack of 
                                  air conditioning and ventilation which meant 
                                  that they were unbearably hot. It will be a 
                                  long time before an inventory can be made of 
                                  all of the objects remaining; the items in the 
                                  storerooms will all have to be systematically 
                                  listed and checked against the museum records. 
                                  Luckily the registration records and catalogue 
                                  cards have not been lost but many of them had 
                                  been scattered around during the looting, one 
                                  of the first jobs that Helen and I had was to 
                                  help some of the museum staff to sort and put 
                                  back all of their catalogue cards. <br>
                                  <br>
                                  Every so often objects were being returned to 
                                  the museum, sometimes as a result of the military 
                                  encountering people with objects and seizing 
                                  them, sometimes because of the military had 
                                  publicised an amnesty policy announcing that 
                                  anyone could return items without fear of reprisal 
                                  and occasionally objects were handed in by people 
                                  who had actually bought them in markets and 
                                  then offered them to the museum. We were accepting 
                                  items whether they came from the museum, archaeological 
                                  sites or elsewhere and a room in the museum 
                                  into which returned objects were being put was 
                                  slowly filling up. Another room of the museum 
                                  is currently full of paintings which were rescued 
                                  from the modern art museum in the former Ministry 
                                  of Culture building which was damaged and heavily 
                                  looted. Other paintings and works of art were 
                                  often being recovered and brought to our attention.

                                  A number of objects in the galleries and storerooms 
                                  had been damaged during the looting and need 
                                  to be conserved. Some objects have suffered 
                                  as a result of the bombing. Boxes of artefacts 
                                  including the gold jewellery from the Iraqi 
                                  excavations at Nimrud as well as display panels 
                                  of jewellery from Ur had been stored in a vault 
                                  at the Central Bank. During the war the vault 
                                  was flooded and all of the objects saturated. 
                                  After the vault was pumped out I spent two weeks 
                                  working at the bank helping museum staff to 
                                  unpack the wet objects, dry them and then repack 
                                  them in clean dry containers. Most of the stone 
                                  and gold items have survived well but others 
                                  such as ivories need specialist conservation 
                                  treatment. <br>
                                  It was not just ancient objects which were taken 
                                  and, as was the case with a great number of 
                                  buildings in Baghdad, anything that could be 
                                  removed had been stolen. All the offices, laboratories 
                                  and rooms of the museum and of the Department 
                                  of Antiquities staff had been looted. Almost 
                                  all the doors and windows were broken, most 
                                  of the furniture had been stolen, as well as 
                                  most equipment, especially the conservation 
                                  and photographic equipment and electrical items 
                                  including all the air conditioning units. There 
                                  was a lot of mess everywhere and problems with 
                                  the water supply meant that during June and 
                                  early July water had to be brought in by tanker 
                                  in order for any cleaning to be done. It was 
                                  clear that in order for the staff to be able 
                                  to return to work, their working conditions 
                                  would have to be improved and a large proportion 
                                  of my time in Baghdad was spent on this. There 
                                  was some money available from the CPA and also 
                                  some from other sources such as the US State 
                                  department but co-ordination was necessary so 
                                  that the money and help offered were channelled 
                                  into what was needed. I arranged for things 
                                  such as new doors to be made, windows installed 
                                  and painting of the walls in the offices to 
                                  be done. Due to problems with getting actual 
                                  money into Iraq much of the furniture, computers, 
                                  photocopiers, stationery supplies and other 
                                  items which were needed were bought in Jordan 
                                  and sent by truck to us at the museum. This 
                                  was not a straightforward process, involved 
                                  lots of people and there was a slight danger 
                                  of the trucks being hijacked, but slowly the 
                                  offices began to look much better. A number 
                                  of institutions including The British Museum 
                                  and universities in the USA, organisations such 
                                  as UNESCO and the Ministries of Culture of a 
                                  variety of countries are offering assistance. 
                                  In July an assessment of the conservation needs 
                                  of the Iraq Museum was carried out by two senior 
                                  conservators from The British Museum and there 
                                  are plans underway for training of Iraqi conservators 
                                  at The British Museum and for an international 
                                  team of conservators to go to Baghdad to help 
                                  with the conservation of objects. New conservation 
                                  laboratories are going to be equipped with funding 
                                  from Italy, and UNESCO are intending to help 
                                  with refurbishment of the museum and storerooms. 
                                  An assessment of the broken-down electrical, 
                                  security and plumbing systems has recently been 
                                  carried out by a US State Department team. Scholarships 
                                  are being offered to Department of Antiquities 
                                  staff by various institutions so that they can 
                                  visit museums in other countries and receive 
                                  training in a variety of subjects but currently 
                                  the fact that passports cannot be issued yet 
                                  is delaying this. <br>
                                  There are 14 other smaller museums in Iraq which 
                                  have also been affected to differing extents. 
                                  Fortunately most of them were not displaying 
                                  original artefacts prior to the war, but there 
                                  has been looting and damage to many. Restorations 
                                  and repairs have now been completed at the Babylon 
                                  Museum with display panels and models being 
                                  reinstalled, and Baquba museum has also been 
                                  renovated. [This latter was subsequently badly 
                                  damaged when the adjacent Police Station was 
                                  bombed.] <br>
                                  <br>
                                  There is still a great deal of work to be done 
                                  before the museums can be fully functioning 
                                  again, the archaeological sites are safe from 
                                  looters and the problems facing many other aspects 
                                  of the culture of Iraq are resolved, but improvements 
                                  are slowly happening. </font><br> <p> </p>
