                                    The conference was organised by the Istituto 
                                    Italiano di Cultura in Brussels. In the evening 
                                    of Thursday 4 December there was a reception 
                                    in the Royal Academy in Brussels where an 
                                    exhibition of photographs had been mounted, 
                                    mainly of reliefs in Sennacherib&#8217;s Palace 
                                    at Nineveh. There were also some small pieces 
                                    of original relief. A booklet was available 
                                    in various languages about the conference 
                                    and the exhibition. The first sentence reads: 
                                    &#8220;The responsibility for the cultural 
                                    heritage, which was assigned to Italy in the

                                    represents an efficient division of tasks&#8221;.

                                    On Friday 5 December, the conference, held 
                                    in the Royal Academy, started with speeches 
                                    of welcome from Pailuisa Bianco (Director 
                                    of the Italian Cultural Institute in Brussels), 
                                    Donny George (substituting for the Iraqi Minister 
                                    of Culture), and Giuseppe Proietti (Director-General 
                                    of Antiquities of Italy). <br>
                                    <br>
                                    Mario Bondioli Osio (head of cultural affairs 
                                    in the Coalition Provisional Authority) started 
                                    his presentation by asking for one minute&#8217;s 
                                    silence for the two Japanese diplomats who 
                                    had been killed on their way to Kirkuk to 
                                    ascertain what Kirkuk Museum needed, as they 
                                    were also proposing to help provincial museums. 
                                    He said that the Ministry of Tourism and the 
                                    Ministry of Culture would be located in renovated 
                                    buildings on Haifa Street. The new National 
                                    Library would be in what used to be the Republican 
                                    Guards&#8217; headquarters. There were currently 
                                    two million books, and future donations would 
                                    take the total to three million within 10 
                                    years. He said that the Ottoman archives, 
                                    the Kingdom of Iraq archives and most of the 
                                    book collection had been saved. Other projects 
                                    included the theatre and cinema complex. He 
                                    then moved on to the protection of archaeological 
                                    sites. Organised looting was ongoing. It had 
                                    been stopped in Nasiriya, but had increased 
                                    in neighbouring provinces. They were proposing 
                                    to introduce a &#8220;facility protection 
                                    system&#8221; of the type developed in Italy 
                                    for protecting banks, embassies, etc, by guards 
                                    specifically trained for the purpose who were 
                                    not police or army. <br>
                                    <br>
                                    Francesco Caruso (permanent UN representative 
                                    for education, science and culture) described 
                                    all the actions taken by UNESCO to save the 
                                    Iraqi Cultural Heritage. He referred to Resolution 
                                    1483 article 7, which gave UNESCO a mandate 
                                    to take responsibility for the Iraqi cultural 
                                    heritage. <br>
                                    The morning session after the coffee break 
                                    was concerned with archaeology in Iraq before 
                                    the war. The first speaker was Giorgio Gullini 
                                    (University of Turin) who detailed the various 
                                    projects he had initiated. <br>
                                    <br>
                                    John Curtis (Department of the Ancient Near 
                                    East, British Museum) described the British 
                                    excavations at Nimrud 1845-1989.<br>
                                    Paolo Fiorina (University of Turin) talked 
                                    about the Italian excavations in Fort Shalmaneser 
                                    at Nimrud in the late 1980s. <br>
                                    <br>
                                    At the beginning of the lecture of McGuire 
                                    Gibson (Oriental Institute, University of 
                                    Chicago) the projector broke down and he gave 
                                    the lecture without slides. Firstly, he reviewed 
                                    the American excavations at Nippur from 1889 
                                    onwards; secondly, he explained that the Oriental 
                                    Institute of Chicago has spent the last 13 
                                    years documenting archaeological sites from 
                                    survey and satellite images. Five-thousand 
                                    had been noted to date, which is a fraction 
                                    of the true number; thirdly, he expressed 
                                    the view that for at least the next decade 
                                    archaeologists will be preoccupied with reconstruction, 
                                    and excavation at large sites will not be 
                                    possible for the conceivable future.<br>
                                    <br>
                                    Antonio Invernizzi (University of Turin) talked 
                                    about Seleucia on the Tigris, and Beatrice 
                                    Andr&eacute; Salvini (Louvre) described the 
                                    French excavations at Tello since 1877. Margarete 
                                    Van Ess (German Archaeological Institute, 
                                    Berlin) described the results of recent geophysical 
                                    survey work at Uruk that was interrupted by 
                                    the war. Lastly in this session, Roberta Venco 
                                    Ricciardi (University of Turin) described 
                                    her excavations at Hatra between 1995 and 
                                    2000.<br>
                                    <br>
                                    After a buffet lunch in the Royal Academy, 
                                    Pietro Cordone talked about his stint as cultural 
                                    adviser. He was proud that a number of the 
                                    projects started during his tenure are now 
                                    making headway, and he referred specifically 
                                    to the work of Dr Proietti, the British Museum, 
                                    UNESCO and the Italian carabinieri. Mr Ugo 
                                    Zottin (head of the carabinieri) was with 
                                    him for a month and did an excellent job. 
                                    Thanks to Nawalla al-Mutawalli, 8,000 objects 
                                    representing 80% of the artefacts exhibited 
                                    in the Iraq Museum had been deposited in a 
                                    sealed store, and were now safe, and Cordone 
                                    thought she deserves recognition for this. 
                                    Amongst the positive outcomes of his tenure 
                                    were the recovery of the Warka vase, the Warka

                                    Mr Franco Frattini (Italian Minister of Foreign 
                                    Affairs) said that Italy has an important 
                                    role to play in the reconstruction of the 
                                    Iraqi cultural heritage. Italy was well suited 
                                    to this, and was playing a leading role, first 
                                    under the direction of Ambassador Cordone 
                                    and now under the direction of Ambassador 
                                    Bondioli Osio. This was a great honour for 
                                    Italy but also a great responsibility. The 
                                    carabinieri had also made an important contribution.<br>

                                    Mounir Bouchenaki (Director of the Archaeological 
                                    Culture section of UNESCO) said that UNESCO 
                                    had been given the responsibility of co-ordinating 
                                    the international rescue effort. <br>

                                    Ugo Zottin (Italian carabinieri) gave some

                                    organisation and paid tribute to the four

                                    Donny George (Iraq Department of Antiquities 
                                    and Heritage) said that $1,700,000 had now 
                                    been allocated for the refurbishment of the 
                                    Iraq Museum. Contracts were now being signed 
                                    for air conditioning, windows, doors and rehabilitating 
                                    the children&#8217;s museum. The Babylon museum 
                                    had already been restored, as had the Baquba 
                                    Museum but the latter had subsequently been 
                                    destroyed by a bomb in the next-door police 
                                    station. The French cultural attach&eacute; 
                                    had promised to build a museum in Samarra. 
                                    The latest position with the Iraq Museum objects 
                                    was that 14,000 had been stolen, 4,000 returned, 
                                    there were 1000 in the USA and 200 in Jordan. 
                                    By the 27 April 12 cases of material had been 
                                    seized in Jordan. There was no information 
                                    from Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Iran, Syria or 
                                    Turkey. No tablets had been stolen from the 
                                    Iraq Museum. In terms of personnel, 20 young 
                                    Iraqi archaeologists were going to the USA 
                                    for training and 10 were going to France. 
                                    Work had already started on the refurbishment 
                                    of the laboratory in the Iraq Museum with 
                                    Italian and Japanese support. M. Bouchenaki 
                                    had been organising talks in Paris about the 
                                    installation of the laboratory involving the 
                                    donors and the Iraqis. Three Iraqi conservators 
                                    were going the UK for two months, and an international 
                                    team of conservators organised by the British 
                                    Museum would be going to Iraq soon thereafter. 
                                    The Iraq Museum library had been completely 
                                    saved. Donations of books should be made through 
                                    the British Museum and the Oriental Institute 
                                    in Chicago. Lastly, he expressed his support 
                                    for Ambassadors Cordone and Bondioli-Osio 
                                    and appreciation for what they had done.<br>

                                    Fawas Khreisheh (Director of Antiquities of 
                                    Jordan) said that between 1991 and 1998, 1065 
                                    objects were confiscated and returned to Iraq 
                                    in 1998. Amongst objects confiscated recently 
                                    have been tablets, gold jewellery, figurines, 
                                    seals, glass vessels, an ivory panel from 
                                    Nimrud (a bed-head) and some fakes.<br>
                                    <br>
                                    <strong>Fawas suggests that the main problems 
                                    confronting the Jordanian authorities are:</strong><br>

                                    programme which should encompass the following

                                    3) Recovery of objects. This should be discussed 
                                    by the neighbouring countries (UAE, Lebanon,

                                    Helga Trenkwalder (University of Innsbruck) 
                                    described how she had been in Iraq in April-May, 
                                    when Austria had been able to provide some 
                                    immediate ad hoc assistance, and again in 
                                    October. During the latter visit she was struck 
                                    by the fact that the museum perimeter was 
                                    still not being properly safeguarded. Also, 
                                    at Babylon she saw archaeological deposits 
                                    being removed by shovel to create earthwork 
                                    defences. This was happening in spite of the 
                                    protests of Dr Miriam who was now in charge 
                                    of Babylon. At Borsippa a small amount of

                                    was a complex of six rooms, and he said the 
                                    installation work should be completed by the 
                                    end of the year.<br>

                                    he was involved in trying to prepare exhibitions 
                                    for the reopening of the Iraq Museum. He wanted 
                                    to set up a &#8220;minimum visit&#8221; in 
                                    the museum in order to give people the idea

                                    After a break, the last session was devoted 
                                    to the &#8220;Nineveh project&#8221;, which 
                                    is an Italian initiative to record and restore 
                                    the reliefs in the Palace of Sennacherib at 
                                    Nineveh. Dr Giuseppe Proietti (Director-General 
                                    of Antiquities of Italy) said that equipment 
                                    for the Iraq Museum laboratory will be sent 
                                    on a military flight to Baghdad Airport as 
                                    soon as it reopens. He reported that he last 
                                    visited the Palace in September and found 
                                    it badly damaged, mostly by vandalism. Then 
                                    members of the team gave their reports. Stefano

                                    Italy) described the technical process of

                                    since 1990 when Russell photographed the slabs, 
                                    and Ruggero Martines (Superintendent of Heritage
