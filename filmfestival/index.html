  	<p> The First Nations of the Northwest Coast live in a landscape of astonishing riches and beauty.  Their mountains and rivers abound in wildlife, fish and plants.  And their societies reflect this wealth of resources: complex social systems, elaborate feasts, and art that has been seen as among the most compelling creations of human skill and invention.  Or thus it was at the end of the eighteenth century, when Europeans first arrived in the North Pacific.  In the wake of the newcomers came disease, colonisation and colonial government.  Some of the great civilisations of the region were decimated, others dispossessed.  Core aspects of their ways of life were made illegal or treated with scorn.  Yet wherever they could, the cultures endured; and today they are able to celebrate both survival and revival.</p>
	<p>Many filmmakers have gone to the Pacific Northwest coast to document and explore the peoples, the history and the landscapes.  This weekend festival at the British Museum brings together a selection of these films.  They include work that has been of central importance in the renaissance of Aboriginal culture, work that expresses protest as well as recovery, and work that reveals some of the anguish and loss that are still so much a part of life for First Nations.  The programme includes films by three directors who come from First Nation communities, and other films that have been made through close partnership between filmmakers and Aboriginal people.</p>
	<p>The festival will be introduced by Sir David Attenborough, showing his own remarkable film from the Northwest coast, and will include discussions with Aboriginal elders from several of the communities where films in the programme have been made, as well as filmmakers who will be on hand to talk about their work.</p>
