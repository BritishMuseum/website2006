<h1>Tlina: Rendering of Wealth</h1>
<p>
<strong>Directed by  Barb Cranmer, 1999, 50 mins</strong><br />
Barb Cranmer is a First Nations filmmaker whose work celebrates many aspects of Northwest Coast society.  In this film, she travels with members of her family on their annual trip to the eulachon fishery and discovers just what it means to be able to make the “grease” that has, for centuries, been one of the most important trade items for many of the peoples of the region.  We are brought to the fishery, the meaning of the grease and through these back to the Potlatch.
