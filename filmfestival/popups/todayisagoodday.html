<h1>Today is a good day: remembering Chief Dan George</h1>
<p>
<strong>Directed by Loretta Todd, 1998, 48 mins</strong><br />
Chief Dan George became a symbol of Indian determination to challenge stereotypes  at the centre of American movies.  His reality – as a member of a First Nations community and as an actor of extraordinary depth and commitment – came to be as important as the roles he played.  Loretta Todd’s film is a compelling exploration of the history and images that shaped Chief Dan George’s life as a maker of new kinds of history and real forms of image.
