<h1>Totem: the Return of the G’psgolox pole</h1>
<p>
<strong>Directed by Gil Cardinal, 2003, 70 mins</strong><br />
The Haisla people discover that a magnificent totem pole was taken from one of their villages in 1929 to a museum in Stockholm. They begin a complex negotiation for its return.  This beautifully crafted film follows the story, and includes – at the centre of events – the carving of new, replica poles.  The drama of the story comes from the shaping of the wood as much as the shaping of new cultural politics.
