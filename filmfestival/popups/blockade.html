<strong>Directed by Nettie Wilde, 1993, 90 mins</strong><br />
Nettie Wilde leads this personal journey to the land of the Gitksan and Wet’suwet’en peoples of northern British Columbia.  She follows the ideas behind the land claim, and finds herself caught up in some of its conflicts  This is a dramatic film set right at the frontier between Aboriginal peoples and the settlers who have occupied most of their land.  It also brings us to the very start of the most important Aboriginal rights legal action in modern history.
