<h1>A Strict Law Bids us Dance</h1>
<p>
<strong>Directed by Dennis Wheeler, 1975, 54 mins</strong><br />
The Potlatch – feast, ceremony, dance and legal process all combined – is the most famous and important institution in Northwest Coast societies.  This film, which has become a landmark classic of Indian revival, was made in the 1970s very much in collaboration with, and for the Kwakwaka’wakw people of Alert Bay. It tells the story of the potlatch – from attempts by government and missionaries to suppress it altogether, to its place in modern life.
