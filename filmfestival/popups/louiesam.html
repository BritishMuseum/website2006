<h1>The Lynching of Louie Sam </h1>
<p>
<strong>Directed by David McIlwraith, 2004, 52 mins</strong><br />
This drama-documentary tells the story of a lynching that took place on the Canadian – American border at the end of the nineteenth century.  The film uses First Nation actors to recreate events and, at the same time, to explore what lies behind stories of this kind.  Self-reflecting and engaged with wide questions about how history is formed and told, this is a remarkable and ambitious film.
