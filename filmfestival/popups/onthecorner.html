<h1>On The Corner</h1>
<p>
<strong>Directed by Nathaniel Geary, 2003, 95 mins</strong><br />
This harrowing and brilliant film explores the world of those who come from First Nations to live in the city.  This is a world of drugs, drifting, solitude and deep vulnerability.  It is also a world where intimacy of family and of love create both acute risk and forms of redemption. <em>On The Corner</em> comes from Aboriginal filmmakers – director and actors are working with deep personal understanding.  This is an important, powerful and disturbing film
