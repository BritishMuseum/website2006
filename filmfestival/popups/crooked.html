<h1>Crooked Beak of Heaven</h1>
<p>
<strong>Directed by David Attenborough, 1976,  50 mins</strong><br />
Made for the BBC series <em>The Tribal Eye</em>, Attenborough leads us to some of the centres of culture of the Northwest Coast.  This is an elegant and powerful introduction to the dance, masks, feasts and forests of both Vancouver Island and the northern British Columbia mainland.  Glimpses of archive, including clips from film shot by Edward Curtis in 1914, add to the film’s many textures. </p>
