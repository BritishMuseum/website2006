<h1>Years From Here: Part 2 of Changing Ground</h1>
<p>
<strong>Directed by John Walker, 2000, 50 mins</strong><br />
The return visit: a group from Papua New Guinea visit the villages and lands of the Sto:lo in the Fraser Valley.  The Sto:lo hosts welcome their exotic visitors with drums, show them the salmon fishery and other elements of Sto:lo culture – with the poignancy of much sense of loss, especially of language.  Made for TV, this is a strong and accessible journey into some of the deepest puzzles about modern Aboriginal society.
