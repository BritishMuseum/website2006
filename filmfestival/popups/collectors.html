<h1>The new collectors: repatriation part 2</h1>
<p>
<strong>From the Ravens and Eagles documentary series, 2003, 24 mins</strong><br />
Many of the great museums of the world have built magnificent collections of art and artefacts from the North Pacific coast.  Many First Nations are now calling for museums to return at least parts of their collections to the peoples they came from. This film, part of the Ravens and Eagles series, shows the poignant and intense debate between people from Haida Gwaii and curators of the British Museum. It also lets us see some of the gems of the Museum’s collection.
