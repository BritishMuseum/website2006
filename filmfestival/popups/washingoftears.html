<h1>The Washing of Tears</h1>
<p>
<strong>Directed by Hugh Brody, 1994</strong><br />
Many Aboriginal peoples have made a direct link between culture and healing, looking to their heritage for ways of addressing and redressing the harm and losses they have endured.  This film tells the story of loss and revival among the Mowachaht and Muchalaht peoples of the far west coast of Vancouver Island.  It also tells the story of one of the most extraordinary and impressive cultural artefacts, taken from the people by the American Museum of Natural History.  This is a film about grief and recovery from grief.
