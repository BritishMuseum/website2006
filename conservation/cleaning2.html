      <p>T<font face="Arial, Verdana, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">he Rosetta 
        Stone was discovered in 1799 and deciphered in 1824. The stone was acquired 
        by the museum in 1802 and has been on display since then. In October 1998, 
        it looked like a black stone with a white inscription.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Verdana, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Analysis 
        of the stone has shown that it is a granite-like rock and not a basalt 
        as it has previously been described. Samples of the surface soiling were 
        analysed to ensure that no ancient material would be removed during cleaning 
        and tests to determine the best cleaning methods were undertaken. Waxes, 
        oils, printer's ink and white paint were identified. The waxes and oils 
        were mostly from handling grease, but some of the wax may have been applied 
        as a protective coating at some stage in the stone's history. Soon after 
        its discovery, paper copies of the inscription were made by inking the 
        surface of the stone and using it like a printing block. This is thought 
        to be the source of the ink. The white paint in the inscription was applied 
        around 1980 to make it more legible.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Verdana, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">All of these 
        contaminants, including the white paint, were removed to reveal a grey 
        stone with a natural sparkle and a broad pinkish vein at the top. White 
        painted inscriptions, contemporary with its acquisition, record on the 
        left side 'Captured in Egypt by the British Army in 1801' and on the right 
        'Presented by King George III'. This evidence of the stone's modern history 
        was not removed. For comparative purposes, a small area of the surface 
        has been left uncleaned at the bottom left hand corner.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Verdana, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">An improved 
        system of display will prevent visitors touching the stone and different 
        lighting will make the inscription legible without the use of white paint.<br>
