      <p><font face="Arial, Verdana, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">An extremely 
        deteriorated bone/antler comb was received in the Organic Artefacts Conservation 
        Studio following its excavation from an Anglo-Saxon cemetery at Buckland, 
        Kent, (Figure 1). Tissue paper, used on site to hold the comb together 
        as it was lifted, was sticking to it. In the laboratory careful cleaning 
        was carried out under the microscope using solvents and small tools, revealing 
        the presence of a comb and comb case.<br>
        <br>
        Whilst Anglo-Saxon combs are not un-common, a comb-case is a very rare 
        find. Both were badly damaged and degraded. The central bone layer, from 
        which the teeth had been cut, was broken into several fragments. This 
        was held between two outer plates. The comb had been slotted into a case, 
        consisting of two bone plates held on an internal frame.</font></p>
      <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Verdana, Helvetica, sans-serif">Both comb 
        and case were decorated with incised decoration. Their components had 
        been held together with iron rivets. During burial the bone had distorted 
        and cracked. The rivets were severely corroded.After cleaning, the fragments 
        were strengthened with consolidants. Broken joins were repaired and an 
        adhesive was used to hold the component layers together. All the consolidants 
        and adhesives used can be removed in the future if necessary. Due to the 
        distortion from burial it was not possible to replace the comb in its 
        case. The rivets were also not replaced; corrosion had increased their 
        size so that even after cleaning they would have prevented the correct 
        positioning of fragments.</font></p>
