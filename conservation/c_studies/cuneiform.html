        Cuneiform tablets</font></b></font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Verdana, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Cuneiform 
        tablets were first made in the third millennium BC in Mesopotamia. They 
        were made by incising script on clay tablets which were then sun baked. 
        Cuneiform tablets provide an unparalleled resource for scholars of the 
        ancient Mesopotamian civilisation. The British Museum holds a collection 
        in excess of 120,000 of these tablets, which originated from twenty two 
        major sites and is possibly the largest in the world. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Verdana, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Cuneiform 
        tablets are fragile, having only been sun baked and are often contaminated 
        with salt. Scholars need to handle tablets to decipher the text. The collection 
        is very frequently consulted and consequently undergoes heavy handling. 
        A conservation treatment was developed in the 19th Century to impart structural 
        strength and allow the tablets to be handled without resultant damage. 
        The treatment was introduced into the British Museum in the 1950s and 
        consisted of heating the tablets slowly to 740&deg;C, cooling, and then 
        desalinating by immersion in running water. No attempt was made to characterise 
        the clays, or to establish whether the same firing cycle would be appropriatefor 
        groups of tablets from different sites. In the 40 years since the treatment 
        was introduced in the British Museum some difficulties have been experienced 
        with tablets from several locations; these present a variety of problems.</font>
