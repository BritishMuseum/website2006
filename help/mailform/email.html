    <h1>Information Request: E-Mail Address Field</h1>
    <p>
      You <em>may</em> fill in these fields, but you do not have to
      unless you want to.  As it is difficult quickly to validate an
      email address, and to check that it can be delivered to, we have
      to ask you to enter it twice, so that you are certain that you
      have entered a valid e-mail address. Museum staff may then send
      requested information to that e-mail address, if it is
      appropriate to do so.
