        Building</b></font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In 1754/ 5 the British 
        Museum acquired Montagu House in Bloomsbury, and remains on this site 
        today. The first Montagu House, architect Robert Hooke (1635-1703), was 
        built c.1676 for Ralph, Duke of Montagu on land purchased from Rachel, 
        heiress of the Earl of Southampton, who married William Russell, later 
        Duke of Bedford. Damaged by fire in 1686, Montagu House was restored by 
        a French architect, 'Puget', in the French style. In its time it was considered 
        to be one of the finest buildings in London.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">By the turn of the 
        century Montagu House was no longer capable of coping with the Museum's 
        vastly increased collections. The Trustees set up a Buildings Committee 
        in 1802 to plan for expansion. The first extension, the Townley Gallery, 
        was constructed 1804-8 to provide space for the classical sculpture collection 
        of Charles Townley and for Egyptian antiquities. The architect was George 
        Saunders (c.1762-1839). Built in Palladian style, it was located in the 
        space currently occupied by the southern section of the Egyptian Sculpture 
        Gallery. It was demolished in 1842-6 to make way for the Smirke building.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The core of today's 
        building, including the great south front, was designed in 1823 by Sir 
        Robert Smirke (1780-1867) in Greek Revival style, but not completed until 
        1852. The catalyst for its construction was the gift to the nation by 
        George IV of his father's library (the King's Library) for which Parliament 
        voted funds for a repository. Smirke's basic concept was of a quadrangle, 
        initially built in the garden to the north of Montagu House, the southern 
        wing eventually replacing the old building. Additional galleries for classical 
        sculpture and Assyrian antiquities were added to the west wing and there 
        were projecting residences for staff. The finest room is the east wing, 
        the King's Library, begun in 1823 and completed in 1827. Robert Smirke 
        withdrew from the work in 1845, handing over completion of the project 
        to his younger brother Sydney who was responsible for the Front Hall, 
        the completion of the main (central) section of the south front and colonnade, 
        the forecourt and railings.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In 1852 the proposal 
        was put forward that Robert Smirke's empty quadrangle be occupied by a 
        desperately needed new building for the library. The initial concept came 
        from Sir Antonio Panizzi, then Keeper of Printed Books, later Principal 
        Librarian. Sydney Smirke (1798-1877) was the architect. Work on the construction 
        of the Reading Room, a circular domed reading area surrounded by rectangular 
        bookstacks, took place 1854-7. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The White Wing, facing 
        Montague Street, was constructed 1882-5, architect Sir John Taylor (1833-1912). 
        The Museum had again been looking to expand and fortuitously a bequest 
        made by William White (d.1823) became available after the death of his 
        widow who had a life interest.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">King Edward VII's 
        Galleries, fronting Montague Place, were intended as the first phase of 
        an expansion of the Museum which would replace all the surrounding properties, 
        the freeholds of which had been purchased from the Bedford Estates in 
        1894-5. The architect was Sir John Burnet (1859-1939), working in Beaux 
        Arts style. The foundation stone was laid by King Edward VII in 1907 and 
        the building was opened by King George V and Queen Mary in 1914. Protection 
        orders on surrounding buildings mean that Burnet's scheme can now never 
        be completed.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">An agreement to fund 
        the construction of a gallery for the Parthenon Sculptures ('Elgin Marbles') 
        was concluded with Sir Joseph (later Lord) Duveen in 1931. The architect 
        was the American, John Russell Pope (1874-1937) architect of the National 
        Gallery in Washington. The Duveen Gallery was completed in 1939 but, because 
        of war damage, it was not opened until 1962.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The New Wing, was 
        constructed 1975-78 with a formal opening in 1980. The intention was to 
        provide public facilities (exhibition gallery, restaurant, etc) and offices 
        but, because of cuts in government spending, only half the scheme was 
        completed. The architect is Sir Colin St John Wilson, architect of the 
        British Library at St Pancras.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Queen Elizabeth 
        II Great Court, architect Lord Foster of Thames Bank, was opened by The 
        Queen on 6 December 2000. Following the departure to St Pancras of the 
        Museum's library departments, now part of the British Library, in 1998 
        the bookstacks surrounding Sydney Smirke's round Reading Room were dismantled 
        and a new floor constructed across the courtyard. This was then roofed 
        over to provide the largest covered square in Europe. The Reading Room 
        was restored to its 1857 decorative scheme and new facilities (Clore Education 
        Centre, Sainsbury African Galleries, Ford Young Visitors Centre, BP and 
        Stevenson Lecture Theatres) constructed below.</font></p>
