These festivals attract several million visitors               to the region and are the focus of cultural politics as towns and               cities emphasise the distinct artistic styles of their festivals.               Although most people in Japan have heard of the festivals of Aomori               and Hirosaki, other local towns such as Kuroishi, Goshogawara and               Ominato also have procession of giant lanterns at this time of year.</b></font></p>            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFCCFF"><b>               Hirosaki is a castle town known for its neputa, lantern floats in               the shape of fans rising from a square base on which they sometimes               rotate. The fan shape provides two large surfaces which are used               as a canvas by renowned local artists. Each side has a different               style of painting: the front generally shows a fierce battle scene               taken from historical records or famous Japanese tales while the               back is characterised by the portrayal of a beautiful woman often               framed by scenes of death. The floats are some 10-15 metres high               with articulated flaps at the top that are lowered to pass under               street signs and electrical cables. The procession of over sixty               floats is slower than in Aomori: there is no dancing and the music               also has a slower rythm. According to local interpretation, the               Hirosaki Neputa Festival is about soldiers going off to war and               generally has a more sombre mood, while the Aomori Nebuta Festival               celebrates their boisterous and victorious return from battle. </b></font></p>            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFCCFF"></font></p>            </td>          <td width="380" valign="middle" height="313" align="center"><img src="slices/reg_pic.jpg" width="246" height="158"></td>        </tr>        <tr>           <td width="370" valign="top" height="140"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFCCFF"><b>Gigantism             is taken to its extreme in Goshogawara where the floats on parade             can be between 25 and 30 metres high. Far fewer are on parade (five             in 2000) than in the festival processions of other nearby towns. Recently             revived, the festival in Goshogawara has fewer resources and the same             floats may be paraded for two or three years in a row. As opposed             to the flat forms of the Hirosaki neputa, Goshogawara's tachi-nebuta             ('standing nebuta') are made with construction methods similar to             those used in Aomori City. The main differences with the Aomori nebuta             is that they usually portray one character standing upright on an             elaborate narrow tiered platform and that the construction is in parts             that are assembled to create the towering form. </b></font></td>          <td width="380" valign="middle" height="140" align="center">            <p><img src="slices/regional2.jpg" width="157" height="250"></p>            <p>&nbsp;</p>          </td>        </tr>        <tr>           <td width="370" valign="top" height="15">             <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFCCFF"><b>Ominato               is a port on the Shimokita peninsula which stretches north east               around the large bay forming the northern tip of the main island               of Honshu in Japan. Here, the nebuta floats are three-dimensional               scenes similar to those made in Aomori City, but smaller in size.               The narrow street that follows the shore line is the main procession               route and, for most of the way, the floats are paraded sideways               to the great pleasure of the crowds sitting outside the houses.               Where the streets widen and at cross-roads, the floats are made               to turn to give life to the dynamic scenes portrayed. </b></font></p>            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFCCFF"><b>Drums,               flutes and cymbals are played in all these festivals, with a group               of musicians following or preceding each float. </b></font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFCCFF"><b>In               Hirosaki and Aomori, the same tune is played in the procession,               but at a different pace.
