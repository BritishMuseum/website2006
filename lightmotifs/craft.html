              of <i>nebuta</i> floats since they were children and later training 
              under Keizo Kitagawa. Like most <i>neputa </i>artists, this is not 
              his principal activity. He is a plasterer and decorator by trade, 
              but creating <i>nebuta</i> floats is crucial to his sense of being. 
              His comments illustrate a dynamic relation to his art: 'exploring 
              new forms and techniques is crucial for the protection of tradition'. 
              Takashi Kitamura regularly wins prizes for his floats in the Nebuta 
              Festival. In 2001, one of his floats won the overall First Prize 
              and the other came third. He was also awarded the newly re-instated 
              prize for Best Nebuta Artist.</font></p>

            Akira Kitamura draws his purpose in life from his work on the nebuta. 
            His float on the theme of attempt by the Mongols to invade Japan in

              important aspect of his work is to ensure the <i>nebuta</i> is evenly

              cast shadows onto the paper surface.</font></p>

              and different shape, making short cuts impossible. The work is measured
