            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFCCFF">The 
              themes illustrated in the floats paraded in the Nebuta Festival 
              in Aomori are taken from historical, religious and folk tales, but 
              also contain visual puns referring to current events. The n<i>ebuta</i> 
              made for The British Museum in 2001 is entitled ‘Minamoto no Yoshitsune 
              crossing the sea'. Minamoto no Yoshitsune was a 12th century warrior 
              whose popularity and success as a military leader posed a threat 
              to his brother, Minamoto no Yoritomo, who had him killed. He became 
              the tragic hero of many tales, including one in which he survives 
              and flees Japan over the seas with the help of his powerful horse. 
              This is the scene depicted on the <i>nebuta</i> and parallels the 
              voyage of the <i>nebuta</i> artists crossing the seas to the UK 
              to construct the festival float in The British Museum. </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFCCFF">A 
              painting or sketch of the scene forms the visual basis from which 
              the artists elaborate the three-dimensional giant form of the <i>nebuta</i> 
              itself. The paintings also announce the artistic programme for the 
              Aomori festival each year.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFCCFF">The 
              <i>nebuta</i> is made of a wood and wire structure, covered with 
              paper. As this work progresses, an electrical engineer installs 
              between 500 and 800 lightbulbs (and sometimes more) on the inside. 
              The <i>nebuta</i> is then decorated with ink and paints. Melted 
              paraffin wax is used to provide a barrier between the colours and 
              to create the translucent effect for which the <i>nebuta</i> are 
              so famous.</font> </p>
