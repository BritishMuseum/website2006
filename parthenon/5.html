I am assured, however, that the effects are imperceptible to anyone         but an expert, and I think it follows that the intrinsic beauty of the         marbles has not been impaired."</font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><br wp="BR2">        </font> </p>      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">There was also to         be a starred (written) Question from Mr Mander MP on 23 May, asking the         Secretary to the Treasury, 'if he will state the present position with         reference to the cleaning and re-erection of the Elgin Marbles in the         British Museum.'(89). It is not clear whether this was in fact asked,         but the Standing Committee Minutes of the Trustees for 10 June 1939 record         that Mander asked the Question on 6 June and also enquired whether 'it         was correct that the resignation of two officials was connected with the         unauthorised cleaning, and that disciplinary action had been taken.'</font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><br wp="BR2">        </font> </p>      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The same minutes record         that on 26 May, Lieut.-Commander Fletcher asked 'whether the unofficial         cleaning of the Elgin Marbles continued over 15 months, what steps were         taken to bring the methods employed to the notice of the Director during         that period, and, in a further question, why the Director did not occupy         his official residence.' Capt. Crookshank, Financial Secretary to the         Treasury had answered that 'unauthorised cleaning took place for about         15 months prior to last September, and that the cleaning of material was         in the care of Keepers of Departments.'(90)</font></p>      <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> </font>       <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> </font> </p>      </td>    <td valign="top" height="173" align="center" colspan="2" width="36"><br>    </td>  </tr>  <tr>     <td rowspan="2" align="center" height="139" colspan="2" width="36">       <p>&nbsp;</p>    </td>  </tr>  <tr> </tr>  <tr>     <td colspan="4" height="41"><img src="images/home6.gif" width="709" height="49" usemap="#Map" border="0"><map name="Map"><area shape="rect" coords="67,25,124,40" href="index.html"><area shape="rect" coords="475,26,699,43" href="6.html"></map></td>  </tr></table></body></html>
