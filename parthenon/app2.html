The portions of         the Parthenon sculptures in question are three in number, namely, the         Selene horse's head, the Helios group and the figure of Iris, all belonging         to the East Pediment. On the 16<sup>th</sup> of September Mr. Pryce left         the Museum on short holiday leave. The three pieces of sculpture were         then in their proper places in the Elgin Room. Before he went away Mr.         Pryce gave no instructions either to Mr Hinks, who took charge in his         absence, or to anyone else with regard to either moving the sculptures         or cleaning them beyond a direction to Holcombe to prepare a mounting         for the Iris figure which involved its removal from the pedestal. The         Director informed the Board that he had previously reminded Mr. Pryce         that this figure must not even be washed without the authority of Dr.         Plenderleith in view of the precarious condition of its surface. While         Mr. Pryce was absent it came to the notice of the Director on the evening         of Thursday 22<sup>nd</sup> September that tools had been used in the         cleaning of the Parthenon sculptures. He instructed Mr. Hinks on the morning         of 23<sup>rd</sup> September to see that improper methods were not being         used. On Sunday 25<sup>th</sup> September the Director happened to have         occasion to pass through the basement of the Department. He was surprised         to find there the Helios group in process of cleaning. On the bench he         observed a number of copper tools and a piece of coarse carborundum, and         from the appearance of the sculptures he at once saw that the copper tools         had been used on the sculptures. On Monday morning 26<sup>th</sup> September         the Iris was found by Mr. Hinks to be undergoing similar treatment in         an annex of the new Duveen Gallery, and the Selene horse's head in the         Foreman Mason's workshop. The Director ordered all further cleaning operations         to be stopped and instituted an enquiry into what had occurred. Mr. Pryce         returned to duty on Tuesday 27<sup>th</sup> September.</font></p>      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><br wp="BR1">        <br wp="BR2">        </font> </p>      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">5. Although Holcombe         denied that he had used any copper tool in cleaning the horse's head,         which he dealt with himself personally, the Board are satisfied that copper         tools were used by Holcombe and the labourers under him in cleaning all         the three pieces of sculpture in question. Holcombe admitted that apart         from the instruction to prepare a mounting for the Iris figure he had         received no specific instructions from the Keeper or the Assistant Keeper         either to remove or to clean the sculptures. He appears to have assumed         that he was at liberty to proceed at his own hand with the process of         removing and cleaning. He apparently had obtained some strips or rods         of copper from the store and had fashioned those into tools of various         shapes by flattening and sharpening the ends. He said that he had used         similar tools on other occasions for cleaning marble and he apparently         regarded himself as entitled to use them on the Parthenon sculptures.         No effort was made to conceal them and they were lying exposed to full         view on the bench when the Director first observed them.</font></p>      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><br wp="BR1">        <br wp="BR2">        </font> </p>      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">6. In the course of         the evidence given by Holcombe and the labourers it emerged that they         had used tools in cleaning the metopes and frieze on which they had previously         been engaged for some time. The Board did not think it to be within their         duty to make a detailed examination of the metopes and frieze with a view         to ascertaining the extent of the damage done, but they were impressed         by the fact that such improper methods of cleaning had been allowed to         be in operation over so long a period.</font></p>      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><br wp="BR1">        <br wp="BR2">        </font> </p>      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">7. The effect of the         methods employed in cleaning the sculptures has been to remove the surface         of the marble and to impart to it a smooth and white appearance. Mr. Pryce         described the Selene horse's head as having been "skinned." The surface         of the sculptures, showing the evidences of two thousand years of exposure         to the climate of Greece, was a document of the utmost importance. There         being no possible doubt about the history of the Parthenon sculptures         they came to the Museum as authentic masterpieces of Greek work of the         fifth century B.C. and for purposes of study and comparison they are of         inestimable value. The damage which has been caused is obvious and cannot         be exaggerated.</font></p>      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><br wp="BR1">        <br wp="BR2">        </font> </p>      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">8. The Board inquired         as to the staffing and routine of the mason's workshop and as to the methods         of cleaning sculpture. The following statement prepared by the Director         summarises the position:- </font></p>      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><br wp="BR1">        <br wp="BR2">        </font> </p>      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><u>The Staff</u> consists         of 3 Masons and 6 Labourers. The latter are mostly needed for moving heavy         statuary; they are not all masons' labourers by trade, and those who are         have no skill in working stone and marble, and are not allowed by the         rules of the trade to use tools.</font></p>      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><br wp="BR1">        <br wp="BR2">        </font> </p>      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><u>The Foreman Mason</u>         is a foreman mainly in respect of the moving operations, which he directs         and supervises but does not initiate. He does not direct the work of the         other masons, but is responsible to the Keeper for the discipline and         order of the workshop.</font></p>      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><br wp="BR1">        <br wp="BR2">        </font> </p>      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><u>The Masons' work</u>         is done under the specific orders of the Keeper or the officer in charge         of the Department, and demands his personal supervision. It consists mainly         in mounting sculpture, with occasional mending, but cleaning is not masons'         work.</font></p>      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><br wp="BR1">        <br wp="BR2">        </font> </p>      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">All the officers of         the Department knew several years ago that it is dangerous to let masons         clean sculpture, because they are inclined to prefer their own trade processes         to our scientific ones.</font></p>      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><br wp="BR1">        <br wp="BR2">        </font> </p>      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><u>Washing</u> the         sculpture in the Galleries used to be done periodically by the labourers         with ordinary water and hard brushes, but in 1932 this procedure was stopped,         and the Research Laboratory was asked to devise a safer and more effective         method. Dr. Plenderleith then prescribed a neutral solution of medicinal         soft-soap and ammonia, and trained one masons' labourer to apply this         in the proper manner with the proper brushes and distilled water. No other         person washed or cleaned sculpture for the next 4 years, and no washing         was done except by the Keeper's order and under his supervision.</font></p>      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><br wp="BR1">        <br wp="BR2">        </font> </p>      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">It was the tradition         of the Department that the Keeper or the officer in charge made his round         of the masons' shop his first duty in the morning. Important moving operations         or work needing direction during progress often meant a visit from the         Keeper several times a day.</font></p>      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><br wp="BR1">        <br wp="BR2">        </font> </p>      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">9. The Board have         been unable to obtain any satisfactory explanation of the grave departure         in this instance from the proper practice of the Department. They have,         however, ascertained from Mr. Pryce that a foreman employed by Lord Duveen         in connection with the new Parthenon Gallery had expressed Lord Duveen's         desire that the sculptures should be made as clean and white as possible         and this may very well have become known to the workmen.</font></p>      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><br wp="BR1">        <br wp="BR2">        </font> </p>      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">10. While the damage         to the sculptures was directly occasioned by the unauthorised actings         of Holcombe, it is impossible to acquit the Keeper and the Assistant Keeper         of serious dereliction of duty. Their main responsibility is the preservation         and protection of the valuable works of art committed to their care. Nevertheless,         owing to absence of direction and to inefficiency of supervision in the         Department, Holcombe was able to remove and to undertake the cleaning         of the sculptures in question at his own hand without the knowledge, of         either the Keeper or the Assistant Keeper. This can only be taken as indicating         a most unfortunate slackness and want of system in the administration         of the Department. In the case of Mr. Pryce it is true that he had in         the course of this year been suffering from ill health necessitating his         absence from work for two periods, and also that he was on holiday leave         when the particular unauthorised actings of Holcombe with the Pediment         sculptures took place. But the work of cleaning the Parthenon sculptures         was a long and delicate process, calling for a definite programme and         careful and systematic supervision. It was the duty of Mr. Pryce to see         to these matters. It should have been made clear to the staff that no         piece of sculpture must be removed and no piece of sculpture must be cleaned         without specific orders from Mr. Pryce himself or, in his absence, his         deputy. No such step was taken, with the result that Holcombe considered         himself entitled to remove the Helios group and the Selene horse and to         start to clean those two pieces and the Iris statue on his own initiative.         The necessity for specific instructions with regard to the cleaning of         each individual piece was all the more imperative by reason of the fact         that the condition of the sculptures varies considerably and special care         was necessary in certain cases, for example, the Iris statue. Mr. Pryce         informed us that when the cleaning first began he gave instructions to         Holcombe that it was only [to] be done according to the approved methods.         But it was his duty to see that these instructions were being carried         out. In this duty he failed, with the result that tools were improperly         used in cleaning the metopes and the frieze slabs without his ever knowing         it. The improper practice thus begun was continued in the case of the         Pediment sculptures during Mr. Pryce's absence. But the fact that he was         absent on that occasion does not free him from responsibility for the         damage done to these sculptures, since if he had exercised proper supervision         when the cleaning of the metopes first began the practice would have been         stopped at the very beginning. Moreover, when he left for his holiday         he ought to have given proper instructions to his deputy, Mr. Hinks, with         regard to continuing the work of cleaning the sculptures, but he failed         to do so. Mr. Pryce's neglect of his duties is all the more serious in         view of the fact that he had been Deputy Keeper since 27<sup>th</sup>         November 1934 and Keeper since 25<sup>th</sup> June 1936 and had had the         management of the Sculpture Galleries and workshops from 1925 to 1932,         during Mr. Walter's Keepership, and was presumably conversant with the         proper procedure to be observed in connection with the moving and cleaning         of the sculptures under his charge. When questioned as to how this occurrence         could have taken place if there had been proper supervision Mr. Pryce         was unable to answer, and when asked as to what steps should be taken         to prevent the possibility of the recurrence of such an incident he exhibited         little faculty of resourceful suggestion.</font></p>      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><br wp="BR1">        <br wp="BR2">        </font> </p>      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">As regards Mr. Hinks,         who entered the employment of the Museum on 18<sup>th</sup> January 1926         and was promoted to his present rank on 22<sup>nd</sup> June 1936, the         Board find that in his case also there was serious dereliction of duty.         He was in charge of the Department when Holcombe removed the sculptures         in question and set about cleaning them and yet he was quite unaware either         of their removal or of the starting of the cleaning process. If he had         been maintaining proper supervision he could not have failed to be aware         of what was happening. Yet it was not till after the Director had discovered         the mischief that Mr. Hinks, for the first time during Mr. Pryce's absence,         visited the masons' workshop. He failed to carry out at once the orders         given to him by the Director and he did not indicate any realisation of         the seriousness of the matter. Being interested in other sections of the         Department he appears to have shown little concern as to the Parthenon         sculptures which were under his charge while Mr. Pryce was on leave.</font></p>      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><br wp="BR1">        <br wp="BR2">        </font> </p>      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">11. As regards the         disciplinary action to be taken, the Board have been given to understand         that in accordance with the practice in the Civil Service an officer against         whom any charge of default in duty is made is entitled to have a statement         of the charge in writing and to be afforded an opportunity of answering         it. If the Trustees should approve of this Interim Report it will accordingly         be necessary that the relevant passages attributing fault to Mr. Pryce         and Mr. Hinks be communicated to them and that any statements which they         may make in answer should be considered. They should also have an opportunity         of being heard by the Standing Committee, if they so desire.</font></p>      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><br wp="BR1">        <br wp="BR2">        </font> </p>      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Until this procedure         is carried out it would obviously not be proper for the Board to deal         with that part of their terms of reference which directs them "to advise         upon the necessary disciplinary action," and they have also meantimes         postponed the branch of their remit relating to the policy to be adopted         by the Trustees with regard to the publication of the facts.</font></p>      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><br wp="BR1">        <br wp="BR2">        </font> </p>      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Board have accordingly         thought it right at this stage of their Enquiry to present this Interim         Report for the consideration and directions of the Trustees.</font></p>      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><br wp="BR1">        <br wp="BR2">        </font> </p>      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">British Museum</font></p>      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">November, 1938 </font></p>      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> </font></p>      <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> </font>       <p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> </font> </p>      </td>    <td valign="top" height="173" align="center" colspan="2" width="36"><br>    </td>  </tr>  <tr>     <td rowspan="2" align="center" height="139" colspan="2" width="36">       <p>&nbsp;</p>    </td>  </tr>  <tr> </tr>  <tr>     <td colspan="4" height="41"><img src="images/home9.gif" width="709" height="49" usemap="#Map" border="0"><map name="Map"><area shape="rect" coords="270,26,390,43" href="appendices.html"><area shape="rect" coords="400,26,522,44" href="fig1_5.html"><area shape="rect" coords="536,26,630,44" href="bio.html"><area shape="rect" coords="643,27,699,43" href="notes.html"><area shape="rect" coords="68,19,125,57" href="index.html"></map></td>  </tr></table></body></html>
