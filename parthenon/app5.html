When I joined         the BM staff in 1932, in department of Egyptian and Assyrian Antiquities         under Sydney Smith, Forsdyke took some interest in me and caused me to         be appointed London Secretary of the British School. In 1934? Forsdyke         became Keeper of Greek and Roman Antiquities, in which capacity he was         heavily involved in the plans for building the new Parthenon galleries         financed by Lord Duveen, and for the new exhibition there of the 'Elgin         Marbles'. About this time I saved Greek and Roman from some possible embarrassment         by reporting to Forsdyke that I had overheard a journalist boasting of         a 'scoop' in interviewing, without permission, their stonemason - a man         called Fisher - about restorations etc.</font></p>      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><br wp="BR1">        <br wp="BR2">        </font></p>      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In spring 1935 I was         sent out by the Trustees to assist in Mallowan's excavations at Chagir         Bazar in North Syria. I returned to the BM in . At that time my department         (Egyptian and Assyrian) shared with the Greek and Roman department a storage         space known as the Carthaginian Basement. Here I often worked and was         puzzled, amazed and worried at seeing an elderly labourer who sat day         after day using hammer and chisel (to remove lime stalagmites) and wire         brushes (to remove the golden-brown patina) from the Parthenon metopes         and frieze slabs, which were solemnly trundled in to him one by one. I         wondered whether I should intervene here and pondered long; but I felt         much difficulty in thus interfering in another department's affairs. After         all, Forsdyke, though he had by now become Director, must know about it         since he had continued to exercise close control over the whole Duveen         Gallery scheme from the Director's office. The matter, however was shortly         afterwards (how shortly I don't remember) taken out of my hands.</font></p>      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><br wp="BR1">        <br wp="BR2">        </font></p>      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">One day Sydney Smith,         Mallowan and I were down there (I think) at lunch-time when the 'cleaner'         was out. Sydney Smith, noticing what he had been doing, strode over, looked         at his tools, and exclaimed `Good Lord! Do you see what they're doing?         They're cleaning the sculptures with wire brushes!'</font></p>      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><br wp="BR1">        <br wp="BR2">        </font></p>      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">`Yes', I said, `and         I don't like it', (or words to that effect).</font></p>      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><br wp="BR1">        <br wp="BR2">        </font></p>      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">`Don't ever tell anyone         what you've seen here today!' said SS with great finality.</font></p>      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><br wp="BR1">        <br wp="BR2">        </font></p>      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Of course we promised         we wouldn't - indeed I kept my promise for nearly 50 years: however at         the time I took SS to mean that he would accept responsibility and do         or say whatever was necessary. In the upshot, he didn't do anything till         that day in October (?) 1938 when it was reported that the Duveen Gallery         had been finished and the metopes had been installed in the side galleries.         What happened next I only have from hearsay, not personal knowledge, but         I understood that Sydney Smith and Mrs. Gulbenkian were ushered down to         meet Forsdyke in the galleries and Forsdyke remarked of the metopes: `They're         looking very white, aren't they?', to which SS was able to come back with         a smart answer: `You know why, don't you? They've been cleaning them with         wire brushes!!'</font></p>      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><br wp="BR1">        <br wp="BR2">        </font></p>      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The rest is history,         though unpublished: heads rolled in all directions, blistering reports         were written. I heard Plenderleith at the lunch club admit that the surface         of the horse's head or nose from the pediment on which the wretches had         just got started, had been partly removed to the depth of 1/16th". Certainly         the removal of all the patina from the reliefs and metopes was pretty         thorough and has (in my view) removed the top skin of the stone into which         the master sculptor finished off his work, and without which the sculptures         become dead and lifeless, like Roman copies. The appearance of these once         magnificent sculptures before they were thus ruined may only be gauged         now from an old publication. Curiously enough, the only sculptures from         this monument which appear to have survived unscathed are those of the         gods (who seem to have saved themselves), the divine figures in the round         from the west pediment, and the relief showing the seated gods and goddesses         at the centre of the frieze. Perhaps they saved themselves.</font></p>      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><br wp="BR1">        <br wp="BR2">        </font></p>      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Forsdyke sent for         me and asked me why I didn't intervene. I told him I had been forbidden.         He asked me whether if I saw someone murdering his wife I would not have         intervened. I said the cases weren't parallel and it was not for me to         interfere in the affairs of another department (which meant in effect         questioning the Keeper's and even the Director's control) especially when         I had been explicitly ordered not to do so.</font></p>      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><br wp="BR1">        <br wp="BR2">        </font></p>      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">I think Forsdyke forgave         me, but not Sydney Smith with whom a long and very bitter running war         was now started, lasting till they both retired in 1950 or thereabouts.</font></p>      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><br wp="BR1">        <br wp="BR2">        <br wp="BR1">        <br wp="BR2">        <br wp="BR1">        <br wp="BR2">        </font></p>      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">RDB</font></p>      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">February 1984</font></p></td>    <td valign="top" height="173" align="center" colspan="2" width="36"><br>    </td>  </tr>  <tr>     <td rowspan="2" align="center" height="139" colspan="2" width="36">       <p>&nbsp;</p>    </td>  </tr>  <tr> </tr>  <tr>     <td colspan="4" height="41"><img src="images/home9.gif" width="709" height="49" usemap="#Map" border="0"><map name="Map"><area shape="rect" coords="270,26,390,43" href="appendices.html"><area shape="rect" coords="400,26,522,44" href="fig1_5.html"><area shape="rect" coords="536,26,630,44" href="bio.html"><area shape="rect" coords="643,27,699,43" href="notes.html"><area shape="rect" coords="68,19,125,57" href="index.html"></map></td>  </tr></table></body></html>
