On the 16<sup>th</sup> of September Mr. Pryce left         the Museum on short holiday leave. The three pieces of sculpture were         then in their proper places in the Elgin Room. Before he went away Mr.         Pryce gave no instructions either to Mr. Hinks, who took charge in his         absence, or to anyone else with regard to either moving the sculptures         or cleaning them beyond a direction to Holcombe to prepare a mounting         for the Iris figure which involved its removal from the pedestal. While         Mr. Pryce was absent it came to the notice of the Director on the evening         of Thursday, 22<sup>nd</sup> September, that tools had been used in the         cleaning of the Parthenon sculptures. He instructed Mr. Hinks on the morning         of 23<sup>rd</sup> September to see that improper methods were not being         used. On Sunday, 25<sup>th</sup> September the Director happened to have         occasion to pass through the basement of the Department. He was surprised         to find there the Helios group in process of cleaning. On the bench he         observed a number of copper tools and a piece of coarse carborundum, and         from the appearance of the sculptures he at once saw that tools had been         used on the sculptures. On Monday morning, 26<sup>th</sup> September,         the Iris was found by Mr. Hinks to be undergoing similar treatment in         an annex of the new Duveen Gallery, and the Selene horse's head in the         Foreman Mason's workshop.</font></p>      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><br wp="BR1">        <br wp="BR2">        </font></p>      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Although Holcombe         denied that he had used any copper tool in cleaning the horse's head,         which he dealt with himself personally, the Board are satisfied that copper         tools were used by Holcombe and the labourers under him in cleaning all         the three pieces of sculpture in question. Holcombe admitted that apart         from the instruction to prepare a mounting for the Iris figure he had         received no specific instructions from the Keeper or the Assistant Keeper         either to remove or to clean the sculptures. He appears to have assumed         that he was at liberty to proceed at his own hand with the process of         removing and cleaning. He apparently had obtained some strips or rods         of copper from the store and had fashioned those into tools of various         shapes by flattening and sharpening the ends. He said that he had used         similar tools on other occasions for cleaning marble and he apparently         regarded himself as entitled to use them on the Parthenon sculptures.         No effort was made to conceal them and they were lying exposed to full         view on the bench when the Director first observed them.</font></p>      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><br wp="BR1">        <br wp="BR2">        </font></p>      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">While the damage to         the sculptures was directly occasioned by the unauthorised actions of         Holcombe, it is impossible to acquit the Keeper and the Assistant Keeper         of serous dereliction of duty. Their main responsibility is the preservation         and protection of the valuable works of art committed to their care. Nevertheless,         owing to absence of direction and to inefficiency of supervision in the         Department, Holcombe was able to remove the Helios group and the Selene         horse's head, and to undertake the cleaning of all the three sculptures         in question at his own hand without the knowledge of either the Keeper         or the Assistant Keeper who was in charge of the Department at the time.         This can only be taken as indicating a most unfortunate slackness and         want of system in the administration of the Department.</font></p>      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><br wp="BR1">        <br wp="BR2">        </font></p>      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">As regards Mr. Hinks,         who entered the employment of the Museum on 18<sup>th</sup> January, 1926         and was promoted to his present rank on 22<sup>nd</sup> June, 1936, the         Board find that in his case there was serous dereliction of duty. He was         in charge of the Department when Holcombe removed the sculptures in question         and set about cleaning them and yet he was quite unaware either of their         removal or of the starting of the cleaning process. If he had been maintaining         proper supervision he could not have failed to be aware of what was happening.         Yet it was not till after the Director had discovered the mischief that         Mr. Hinks, for the first time during Mr. Pryce's absence, visited the         masons' workshop. He failed to carry out at once the orders given to him         by the Director and he did not indicate any realisation of the seriousness         of the matter. Being interested in other sections of the Department he         appears to have shown little concern as to the Parthenon sculptures which         were under his charge while Mr. Pryce was on leave.</font></p>      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><br wp="BR1">        <br wp="BR2">        </font></p>      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">STATEMENT IN ANSWER         TO THE CHARGE OF NEGLECT OF DUTY</font></p>      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><br wp="BR1">        <br wp="BR2">        </font></p>      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Mr. R.

From then until the Keeper went away         on 16 September I was occupied in arranging and labelling the Bronze room,         and in revising the Catalogue of Bronzes, as well as in dealing with my         share in the general work of the Department which had accumulated during         my absence abroad.</font></p>      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><br wp="BR1">        <br wp="BR2">        </font></p>      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">When I took charge         of the Department on 16 September the political crisis was rapidly developing.         I conceived it to be my first duty to make arrangements for the safeguarding         of the immediately movable and especially fragile and precious objects         in the Gold Ornament Room, the Terracotta Room, the Bronze Room, and the         Vase Rooms. I instructed Mr. Robertson to take charge of the vases, and         devoted myself to the gems and gold ornaments, the bronzes, and the terracottas.         On looking into the departmental records, I found that the salvage-lists         were insufficiently detailed and explicit; and I accordingly drew up new         lists, with instructions where to find the appropriate keys and other         equipment. I made out detailed directions for the salvage, in case of         emergency, of the Gold Ornament Room; and I drew a plan of the Bronze         Room, in order to show the sequence in which its contents were to be removed.         I measured the cases in the Gold Ornament Room and the Bronze Room, in         order to ascertain how many boxes would be needed for the storage of their         contents. I made arrangements with the Keeper of the Department of Coins         and Medals to borrow surplus medal cabinets for the immediate disposal         of the gold ornaments and gems; and I assembled in the Fourth Vase Room         Annexe such packing cases as were forthwith available for the reception         of the select bronzes. I also attended to the Keeper's correspondence,         as well as my own, and other departmental affairs during the Keeper's         absence.</font></p>      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><br wp="BR1">        <br wp="BR2">        </font></p>      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Downstairs, in accordance         with the Keeper's instructions, I superintended the work of Fisher and         Brennan, who were engaged in mounting various pieces of sculpture. I also         visited the Annexe of the new Elgin Room, to inspect the Iris from the         East Pediment, whose base was to be measured for the cutting of a template,         but no work was yet in progress. I noticed that some washing of the lower         part of the figure had recently taken place; but as I had just been away         for several weeks, and as I assumed that the cleaning of this figure,         like that of the rest of the Parthenon sculpture, was contemplated before         removal to the new room, I was not surprised to find that the work had         been started. I did not observe any signs that unauthorized methods of         cleaning had been used, nor were there then any tools or other materials         laid out on the trestle on which the figure stood. I did not then pass         through Holcombe's shop or the other basements, because I had received         no instructions from the Keeper that any work was to be in progress there.         In short, I did not spend as much time in the basement as I should have         spent there in normal circumstances, because I judged that my first duty         during these critical days was to superintend the safeguarding of the         collections in the upper rooms, for which the Director had already issued         general instructions.</font></p>      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><br wp="BR1">        <br wp="BR2">        </font></p>      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">On the afternoon of         23 September (not the morning of that day, as stated in the Report), I         asked to see the Director on various matters of departmental business.         He received me about 3.30 p.m. We discussed first the estimates for the         printing of the Guide to the Department; then the redecoration of the         Third Graeco-Roman Room; then the provision of packing cases and packing         materials for the storage of the contents of the upper rooms in case of         emergency, the Director giving me various instructions in connexion therewith.         The Director then mentioned the cleaning of the Elgin marbles, and expressed         concern at the appearance of some of the slabs of the frieze. He repeated         the conviction of the Trustees that nothing but the method of cleaning         invented by Dr. Plenderleith should be employed on the marbles, even if         this did not achieve the degree of whiteness desired by Lord Duveen. He         then expressed his own fear that unauthorized methods might already have         been employed on the frieze, especially the use of metal scrapers and         abrasives. He then instructed me to look into this matter.</font></p>      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><br wp="BR1">        <br wp="BR2">        </font></p>      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">On the morning of         Saturday, 24 September, in accordance with the usual practice of the Department         no washing or moving of sculpture was due to take place. Following the         Director's instructions of the previous afternoon, I saw Holcombe in the         Third Graeco-Roman Room, and ordered him to move and cover two pieces         of sculpture by the doorway, before the builders arrived to take down         the pediment which the Director had ordered to be removed; and also to         detach a number of reliefs from the wall, in accordance with the Keeper's         instructions, confirmed by the Director. I then examined the slabs of         the frieze indicated by the Director; but although I noticed the whiteness         of which the Director complained, I could not discover any evidence that         unauthorized methods of cleaning had been used, and could form no opinion         whether or not this degree of whiteness was obtainable by Dr. Plenderleith's         method, unassisted by abrasion. As the political situation was by then         becoming increasingly serious, I returned to the Office of the Department         to make arrangements for the provision of boxes and packing materials         of various kinds, also in accordance with the Director's instructions         of the previous afternoon.</font></p>      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><br wp="BR1">        <br wp="BR2">        </font></p>      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Immediately on reaching         the Museum on Monday morning, 26 September I went down to Holcombe's shop         in order to investigate the methods of cleaning in use. I found Holcombe         washing the head of Selene's horse. When I came into the room, he was         using Dr. Plenderleith's method in the approved way; but he had on the         bench various copper tools, a piece of abrasive stone, and various tins         of powdery substance. When I questioned him about the tools, he denied         having used them on the head. I told him on no account to use them, and         ordered him to remove from the bench the tins of powder and the abrasive         stone. When I asked what the powder was, he replied evasively that he         did not know, and that it was something left over from Pinker's time.         My suspicions were then aroused, and I went at once to the Elgin Room         Annexe, where I found two labourers washing the figure of Iris and using         copper tools on the drapery, although Holcombe had told me the moment         before that they were on their honour to use nothing but Dr. Plenderleith's         method. I told them to stop work, and set out to report the matter at         once to the Director. I met him by chance in the galleries. He then told         me that he had given orders for all washing to be stopped; and when I         returned at once to Holcombe's shop and the Elgin Ante-Room, I found that         the Director's message had just arrived. I then wrote a letter containing         an interim report to the Director; and asked the Keeper on the telephone         to return at once.</font></p>      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><br wp="BR1">        <br wp="BR2">        </font></p>      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">On Tuesday, 27 September,         the Keeper returned from leave, and I reported to him at once what had         been happening, and asked him to see the Director immediately.</font></p>      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><br wp="BR1">        <br wp="BR2">        </font></p>      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Meanwhile, the crisis         had become acute; and Mr. Robertson and I completed our precautionary         measures during the ensuing days. On Saturday, 1 October, the crisis being         then over, I went away for a week's leave, returning to the Museum on         Monday, 10 October.</font></p>      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><br wp="BR1">        <br wp="BR2">        </font></p>      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">During the ten days         while I was in charge of the Department the risk of an immediate outbreak         of war led me to decide what the most urgent need of the moment was to         make all possible arrangements for the instant evacuation of the upper         rooms on the outbreak of hostilities. No plans had been communicated to         me for the safeguarding of the sculpture galleries, whereas the necessity         for the clearing of the upper rooms was the subject of several orders         from the Director's office. My answer, therefore, to the charge of neglect         of duty must be that I believed that in these exceptional circumstances         the first duty of the responsible officer irrespective of his specialist         qualifications, was to devote himself to the safeguarding of the collections         in the upper rooms, in accordance with the explicit instructions of the         Director.
