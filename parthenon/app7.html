So far as regards Mr. Pryce the Board when considering         his case were not in possession of the information regarding his state         of health which subsequently became available and which was communicated         to the meetings of the Standing Committee and the Trustees on 10<sup>th</sup>         December. The Board desire to place on record that if, in preparing their         Second Report, they had had before them the medical certificates of Dr.         Gilbert Chubb and Dr. A. J. Reid Taylor their recommendation as regards         Mr. Pryce would have taken a different form. They are satisfied that,         so far as he is concerned, the unfortunate state of matters which the         Board have had to investigate ought in large measure to be attributed         to his breakdown in health. They accordingly find themselves entirely         in agreement with the course adopted at the meeting on 10<sup>th</sup>         December, whereby Mr. Pryce has been granted sick leave for a month on         the understanding that he will resign his appointment when the month expires.         While no similar considerations apply to the case of Mr. Hinks, the Board         recognise the expediency in the circumstances of imposing the penalty         of a severe reprimand and the loss of ten years seniority rather than         terminating his appointment.</font></p>      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><br wp="BR1">        <br wp="BR2">        </font></p>      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">British Museum</font></p>      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">December, 1938.</font></p></td>    <td valign="top" height="173" align="center" colspan="2" width="36"><br>    </td>  </tr>  <tr>     <td rowspan="2" align="center" height="139" colspan="2" width="36">       <p>&nbsp;</p>    </td>  </tr>  <tr> </tr>  <tr>     <td colspan="4" height="41"><img src="images/home9.gif" width="709" height="49" usemap="#Map" border="0"><map name="Map"><area shape="rect" coords="270,26,390,43" href="appendices.html"><area shape="rect" coords="400,26,522,44" href="fig1_5.html"><area shape="rect" coords="536,26,630,44" href="bio.html"><area shape="rect" coords="643,27,699,43" href="notes.html"><area shape="rect" coords="68,19,125,57" href="index.html"></map></td>  </tr></table></body></html>
