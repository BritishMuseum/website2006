It         is a compelling story and deserves to tell itself. I have, therefore,         largely resisted attempting to make value judgements, either of the evidence         itself or of the actions and sayings of the people concerned.

Plenderleith, scientist in charge of the Museum's laboratory,         and Arthur Holcombe foreman of the masons,(61) who were called as witnesses         before the board along with Sydney Smith, Keeper of Egyptian and Assyrian         Antiquities, and V.A. Fisher, mason.The Board's first <em>Interim Report</em>         is dated 7 November 1938.(62) Taking it together with the statements of         Frederick Pryce and Roger Hinks (63), events may be summarised as follows.</font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><br wp="BR2">        </font> </p>      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">'When the washing         began', Pryce recalls, 'I asked Holcombe if he and the men understood         the proper process, and he replied in the affirmative.' By this he must         have meant the cleaning that began in the summer of 1937. He goes on,         'At the outset I spent much time with the men, and the washing whenever         I was present was being done in accordance with the regulation. I have         reexamined the slabs of the frieze which were first washed (in the S.W.         angle of the Elgin Room), and can see no trace of the use of copper tools.         On this point I consulted Dr Plenderleith who, I believe, concurs.' The         sculpture referred to in the S.W. corner of the room are the blocks of         north frieze showing the cavalcade.</font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><br wp="BR2">        </font> </p>      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Subsequently, Pryce         spent less time in the workshop and there was a long period in the spring         of 1938 when he was absent on sick-leave and did not supervise the cleaning         at all. Hinks had returned from leave on 29 August 1938 and was together         with Pryce in the Department, before the latter went on leave on 16 September.         Before leaving, Pryce gave Hinks no special instructions as to cleaning         the Parthenon sculptures. The political crisis in September over Germany's         invasion of Czechoslovakia involved Hinks in the drawing up of emergency         measures for evacuating the collections, with the help of his junior C.M.         Robertson.(64) In accordance with Pryce's instruction, Hinks also superintended         the work of the masons, 'who were engaged in mounting various pieces of         sculpture.' He goes on:</font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><br wp="BR1">        </font> </p>      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> 'I also visited the         Annexe of the new Elgin Room, to inspect the Iris from the East Pediment,         whose base was to be measured for the cutting of a template, but no work         was yet in progress. I noticed that some washing of the lower part of         the figure had recently taken place; but as I had just been away for several         weeks, and as I assumed that the cleaning of this figure, like that of         the rest of the Parthenon sculpture, was contemplated before removal to         the new room, I was not surprised to find that the work had been started.         I did not observe any signs that unauthorized methods of cleaning had         been used, nor were there then any tools or other materials laid out on         the trestle on which the figure stood. I did not then pass through Holcombe's         shop or the other basements, because I had received no instructions from         the Keeper that any work was to be in progress there. In short I did not         spend as much time in the basement as I should have spent there in normal         circumstances, because I judged that my first duty during these critical         days was to superintend the safeguarding of the collections in the upper         rooms, for which the Director had already issued general instructions.'</font></p>      <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> </font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Hinks       comes at last to the Director's revelation to him of his suspicions about       malpractice. He had gone to see Forsdyke on the afternoon of Friday 23 September       to discuss various matters, and at the end of this interview the Director       brought up the matter of the sculptures. In the first <em>Interim Report       </em>it was said that Forsdyke had first become aware that tools had been       used on the sculptures on the evening of Thursday 22 September, but what       is not clear from these papers is how Forsdyke suddenly became apprised       of the fact or why he decided to mention it then, when the cleaning had       been going on for fifteen months. The answer seems to lie in a paper addressed       to Sir David Wilson, dated 9 February 1984, (Appendix 5) which records a       memoir of the episode by Dr R.D. Barnett, then a retired Keeper of Western       Asiatic Antiquities at the Museum.(65) Barnett remarks that he had long       been puzzled as to why an elderly labourer had been allowed to sit - </font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><br wp="BR2">      </font>       <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> 'day after day using         hammer and chisel (to remove lime stalagmites) and wire brushes (to remove         the golden-brown patina) from the Parthenon metopes and frieze slabs,         which were solemnly trundled in to him one by one. I wondered whether         I should intervene here and pondered long; but I felt much difficulty         in thus interfering in another department's affairs. After all, Forsdyke,         though he had by now become Director, must know about it since he had         continued to exercise close control over the whole Duveen Gallery scheme         from the Director's office. The matter however was shortly afterwards         (how shortly I don't remember) taken out of my hands.</font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><br wp="BR2">        </font> </p>      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> One day Sydney Smith         [Keeper of Egyptian and Assyrian Antiquities] and Mallowan [the Assyriologist]         and I were down there (I think) at lunch-time when the 'cleaner' [Holcombe?         In his workshop] was out. Sydney Smith, noticing what he had been doing,         strode over, looked at his tools, and exclaimed 'Good Lord! Do you see         what they're doing? They're cleaning the sculptures with wire brushes!'</font></p>      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> 'Yes', I said, `and         I don't like it', (or words to that effect) .</font></p>      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> 'Don't ever tell         anyone what you've seen here today!' said SS with great finality.</font></p>      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Of course we promised         we wouldn't - indeed I kept my promise for nearly 50 years: however at         the time I took SS to mean that he would accept responsibility and do         or say whatever was necessary. In the upshot, he didn't do anything till         that day in October (?) 1938 when it was reported that the Duveen Gallery         had been finished and the metopes had been installed in the side galleries.         What happened next I only have from heresay, not personal knowledge, but         I understood that Sydney Smith and Mrs. Gulbenkian were ushered down to         meet Forsdyke in the galleries and Forsdyke remarked of the metopes: 'They're         looking very white, aren't they?', to which SS was able to come back with         a smart answer: 'You know why, don't you? They've been cleaning them with         wire brushes!!'</font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><br wp="BR2">        </font> </p>      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Barnett's account         is artfully designed to discredit all but himself. In the Museum he has         a reputation for brilliant scholarship and political cunning. Even in         retirement he sought to influence Museum affairs. At the time of his writing,         there was a plan for re-combining Barnett's old department of Western         Asiatic Antiquities with Egyptian Antiquities, as in the days of Sydney         Smith. Barnett opposed it. His inflammatory memoir is probably designed         to embarrass its recipient, and should be taken with a large pinch of         salt. Certainly, there is no evidence to confirm his mention of wire brushes         'to remove the golden-brown patina.' Perhaps all that can reliably be         inferred from it is that, by saying what he knew, Sydney Smith brought         out an anxiety that had been building in the Director's mind, for some         time.</font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><br wp="BR2">        </font> </p>      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Hinks's account of         his interview with Forsdyke the next day continues:(66)</font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><br wp="BR1">        </font> </p>      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> 'The Director then         mentioned the cleaning of the Elgin marbles, and expressed concern at         the appearance of some of the slabs of the frieze. He repeated the conviction         of the Trustees that nothing but the method of cleaning invented by Dr         Plenderleith should be employed on the marbles, even if this did not achieve         the degree of whiteness desired by Lord Duveen. He then expressed his         own fear that unauthorised methods might already have been employed on         the frieze, especially the use of metal scrapers and abrasives. He then         instructed me to look into this matter.'</font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><br wp="BR1">        </font> </p>      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">On the following Saturday,         Hinks went to look at the frieze and noticed the whiteness of which the         Director had complained, but found no indication as to whether this had         been achieved by unauthorised methods or by Plenderleith's method.</font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><br wp="BR2">        </font> </p>      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">On Sunday 25 September         Forsdyke passed through the basement and was surprised to find that the         Helios group had recently been undergoing treatment. There were copper         tools on the bench and a piece of coarse carborundum. It was obvious the         tools had been used on the sculptures. On Monday the 26th September, Hinks         found Holcombe in his shop with the head of Selene's horse. He was washing         it in the approved way, but on the bench were the various tools and tins         of white powder. Hinks challenged Holcombe, who denied using them on the         head and denied knowledge of the powder, which he claimed was something         left over from the days of his predecessor, William Pinker.(67) His suspicions         aroused, Hinks went immediately to the Annexe of Duveen's new gallery,         where he found two labourers washing the figure of Iris and using copper         tools on the drapery. The work was stopped.</font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><br wp="BR2">        </font> </p>      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Pryce returned to         the Museum on Tuesday 27 September. He declared that it had not been his         intention to proceed with the cleaning of the pediment sculptures until         February of the following year, and that explained why he had not consulted         Plenderleith about 'how far we should wash'. For the same reason he had         said nothing to Hinks, when the latter took over. The only instruction         given to Holcombe had been to take down the 'Iris', fix a new pedestal         and set it up in the new gallery.</font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><br wp="BR2">        </font> </p>      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Board were persuaded,         contrary to claims by Holcombe, that copper tools were used by him and         the labourers under him in cleaning all three pieces. Nor had Holcombe         received any instruction, but had taken it upon himself to clean the sculptures         as he saw fit. He had acquired some strips of copper from the store and         shaped them by flattening and sharpening the ends. Similar tools had been         used on the frieze and metopes. He apparently saw no harm in this and         had made no effort to conceal the tools. The Board, for reasons not given,         'did not think it within their duty to make a detailed examination of         the metopes and frieze with a view to ascertaining the extent of the damage.'         At any rate the effect was recognised as 'to remove the surface of the         marble and to impart to it a smooth and white appearance.' Pryce had described         the horse head of Selene as having been 'skinned'. 'The damage', the report         goes on, 'which has been caused is obvious and cannot be exaggerated.'</font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><br wp="BR1">        </font> </p>      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">It was recalled that         washing the sculptures used to be done in the galleries using water and         hard brushes, that is until in 1932 Plenderleith prescribed a 'neutral         solution of medicinal soft-soap and ammonia', training one mason's labourer         in how to apply this with distilled water. For the next four years only         this person washed the sculptures and this to the Keeper's order. Holcombe         could give no satisfactory reply as to why this practice was deviated         from. Pryce remarked, however, that a foreman of Lord Duveen, who was         employed on the site of the new gallery, 'had expressed Lord Duveen's         desire that the sculptures should be made as clean and white as possible         and this may very well have become known to the workmen.'</font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><br wp="BR2">        </font> </p>      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Trustees were         very critical of Pryce and Hinks for what was regarded as a dereliction         of duty in failing to provide proper supervision over a long period of         time, which failure could not be excused on the basis of periods of absence         through vacation or ill-health. Nor, in Pryce's absence, was it even Hinks         who had discovered the crime, but it had been left for the Director to         reveal.</font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><br wp="BR2">        </font> </p>      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The first <em>Interim         Report </em>was submitted to the Standing Committee of Trustees and accepted.         The Board met for a fourth time on 15 November to complete the enquiry         and to consider what disciplinary action should be taken and to deliberate         on how the facts were to be published. The results of this meeting made         up the second <em>Interim Report</em>.(68)</font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><br wp="BR2">        </font> </p>      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">They re-examined Holcombe         and also questioned J.F. Sinclair and A.E. Simenton, two of the labourers.         Sinclair confirmed that he had been using copper tools to clean the Parthenon         sculptures since June 1937. The report goes on:</font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><br wp="BR1">        </font> </p>      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> 'He also stated that         Daniel, the foreman employed by Lord Duveen, had pointed out to him that         one of the slabs, chosen for Lord Duveen to show in his new gallery, was         not white enough and that Holcombe had previously told him to see if he         could brighten it up. The slab was in consequence recleaned. Daniel commended         him for getting it whiter. The incident is of importance only as showing         that Holcombe and Sinclair and presumably the other workmen were aware         of Daniel's desire that the sculptures should be made as clean and white         as possible for Lord Duveen.</font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><br wp="BR2">        </font> </p>      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> The Board learned         from Holcombe, Sinclair and Simenton that a sum of two or three pounds         had been given by Daniel to Holcombe to be divided among himself and the         workmen after they had performed some heavy work in moving some of the         sculptures, and that this sum was shared among them. The Board do not         associate this payment with the cleaning operations, except in so far         as it was calculated to promote the readiness of Holcombe and the workmen         to comply with Daniel's wishes.'</font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><br wp="BR1">        </font> </p>      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">On the question of         the fate of the officers, it was decided to terminate the employment of         Pryce and Hinks, the conditions as yet undetermined.</font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><br wp="BR1">        </font> </p>      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> On the matter of         a public statement the Board decided that none need be made.

In these circumstances the         Board do not recommend any communication to the Press on the subject.'</font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><br wp="BR1">        </font> </p>      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The second <em>Interim         Report</em> dated 8 December 1938 was presented to the Standing Committee         and the Trustees on 10 December 1938 and was accepted. Afterwards the         Board met again (69) and reconsidered the terms of Pryce's dismissal in         the light of medical evidence, which had since become available to them.         They now found that, 'so far as he is concerned, the unfortunate state         of matters which the Board have had to investigate ought in large measure         to be attributed to his breakdown in health.' After a month's sick-leave,         therefore, Pryce was to be allowed to retire on medical grounds. Hinks         by contrast was to be allowed to remain in post with a severe reprimand         and the loss of ten years seniority. Holcombe was dismissed and ceased         duty on 9 December 1939.(70)</font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><br wp="BR1">        </font> </p>      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Pryce's month of sick-leave         expired and he never returned to his duties, as his retirement on medical         grounds went through. Bernard Ashmole, Yates Professor of Classical Archaeology         in the University of London, joined the Department in January 1939 and         took over Pryce's duties on a part-time basis.(71) On 13 January, his         position no longer tenable or tolerable, Hinks tendered his resignation         to Ashmole. It was accepted by the Board of Enquiry on 14 January 1939(72)         and at a General Meeting of Trustees on 25 February 1939.</font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><br wp="BR1">        </font> </p>      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The surviving correspondence         between Forsdyke and the Board members is largely routine,(73) but two         letters from Lord Harlech are telling.

The Trustees and         you and the whole Museum have been let down badly, and effective disciplinary         action must follow.
