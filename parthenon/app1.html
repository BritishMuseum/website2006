I have regularly inspected         the work and never seen the men using the chisels, and think that this         abuse must be very occasional. The men when questioned admitted that they         have used them on other occasions, but say - only to remove similar accretion.         They state that they have never touched the marble with carborundum.</font></p>      <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><br wp="BR1">      <br wp="BR2">      </font>       <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">I can offer no explanation         of what happened to the Helios in my absence, except that the men may         have been trying to cut short the cleaning process and were not under         continuous supervision.

He was using Plenderleith's mixture with a brush, but on his         bench were a tin of some white powder and a bottle of blue stuff. I asked         him what they were; he replied evasively that he did not know, and that         they were left there from Pinker's day. I told him to take them away.         On his bench were several of these copper scrapers. Holcombe told me that         he had not used them on the horse's head. He also told me that the two         men who were working on the Iris had instructions to use nothing but Plenderleith's         soap with a brush and clean water. I went into the Elgin Annexe and found         them with a complete array of copper scrapers, which they were actually         at that moment using.

It was apparently the intention to remove the whole of         the surface of the marble in this way had the work not been interrupted         by its chance discovery.</font></p>      <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><br wp="BR1">      <br wp="BR2">      </font>       <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">I have examined the         tools used.</font></p>      <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><br wp="BR1">      <br wp="BR2">      </font>       <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The whetted cutting         edges of the copper chisels are decidedly harder than marble and these         edges have nevertheless been blunted and turned over by impact during         use.</font></p>      <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><br wp="BR1">      <br wp="BR2">      </font>       <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The interstices of         the carborundum block were found to be clogged with marble dust particles         and there can be no doubt that its use was not restricted to the sharpening         of chisels. Carborundum is more than twice as hard as marble (9:4 on Moh's         scale) and that any such process should have been entertained in connection         with the Elgin marble collection passes my comprehension.</font></p>      <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><br wp="BR1">      <br wp="BR2">      </font>       <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">I much regret that         it has been possible for such an unfortunate method to have been tried         in view of the work which has already been done to ensure that the mildest         possible neutral reagents would alone be used in removing surface dirt.         In the two marbles in question, the original surface, already largely         gone, can never be restored.
