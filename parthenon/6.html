After the War their re-exhibition was a priority         for Bernard Ashmole.(91) He had resumed his post at the British Museum,         giving up his professorship at University College to devote his energy         to the restoration of the emptied and bomb-damaged galleries of the Greek         and Roman Department. The immediate priority was the recovery of the Elgin         Marbles from their deep shelter in the Aldwych Tube. As Jacob Epstein         pointed out, with his usual tendency to sound cross, a whole generation         of artists was growing up never having seen these sculptures.(92)</font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><br wp="BR2">        </font> </p>      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Duveen Gallery         was a bombed ruin. Ashmole had never been reconciled to its design and         had no compunction, therefore, about making his display of the Marbles         in the old Elgin Room which, of all the sculpture galleries on the ground         floor of the Museum, was the only one still serviceable.(93) The first         of the sculptures to reemerge came out on 25 November 1948. Their sudden         appearance, trundled on trucks through the public concourses of the Aldwych         Tube, attracted Press attention.(94). Neither then, nor in reports of         their eventual display did anybody think to revive the previous controversy.         <em>The Times</em> trumpeted their return and celebrated the 'amazing         brilliance and freshness' of the carving of the animal thought to have         inspired Keats to write of 'that heifer lowing at the skies'.(95) A vindication         of Elgin's actions in rescuing the Marbles was seen in a photograph exhibited         with the casts he had made of the west frieze, which had remained behind         in Athens. The photograph taken in 1938 showed a loss of up to twenty         per cent of the surface that survived in Elgin's day.</font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><br wp="BR2">        </font> </p>      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The <em>Daily Graphic         </em>saw how the sculptures 'glow with a Mediterranean warmth'.(96) The         newspapers, it seems, were prepared to forgive the past and let the sculptures         stand as a symbol of the resurrection of war-torn Britain. The <em>New         Statesman</em>(97) captured the <em>&eacute;lan </em>of the moment: 'To         the post-war generation they are fresh, challenging and alive as once         they were to Keats'. The comparison is again favourably made between the         condition of these sculptures and those left behind in Athens. Not everybody,         however, was prepared to forgive and forget.</font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><br wp="BR2">        </font> </p>      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3" color="#000066"><b>Cesare         Brandi </b></font></p>      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">An active lobbyist         against the removal of what he considered to be protective and aesthetically         enhancing patinas on artworks was Professor Cesare Brandi, head of the         Istituto Centrale del Ristauro in Rome. In 1950 he entered vigorously         into the debate then still raging over the cleaning of pictures at the         National Gallery(98). In the journal of his own Institute(99) he revived         the pre-War controversy: 'We are not dealing with patina, nor with washing         . . .We have here a ferocious skinning, which has removed the first layer         of sculpture . . .'. Brandi believed that certain coatings on the sculptures,         visible today on parts of the Elgin Marbles, were deliberate applications         to the finished sculpture of a thin layer of plaster (<em>intonaco</em>).         He lamented the abrasion of the surface all the more for its having removed         these coatings. 'It is not a question', he says of taking off <em> patina:         </em>those responsible cannot say that it is simply a matter of taste         . . .'</font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><br wp="BR2">        </font> </p>      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">He admitted that the         scouring had not affected all the Marbles: the pediments had escaped,         with the exception of the Hebe (G) of the east. Also he thought the east         frieze figures 28- 61 (100) were unaffected as well as parts of the north         frieze, which he lists nonsensically as figures 12 - 44. All the rest         of the frieze and the metopes are, he says, abraded.</font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><br wp="BR2">        </font> </p>      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Brandi's account suffers         from the hysteria of outrage that so often accompanies public discussion         of art restoration.

Brandi published two further         notes defending his case for all the sculptures of the Parthenon having         once been coated in a coloured layer of plaster which, again, is a claim         that many may find difficult to accept.(101)</font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><br wp="BR2">        </font> </p>      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Besides Brandi, there         has been very little <em>academic</em> interest in the cleaning.

It was that Duveen had in effect         bribed the chief mason, who happened to be a drinker and therefore not         all that trustworthy, to clean a number of the marbles drastically so         as to make them more showy for his new gallery; the mason had removed         the patina, which is that change, mainly in colour, of the surface which         tends to occur with age, especially in Pentelic marble. The crisis had         arisen through a combination of unfortunate circumstances. It was a tradition         that keepers of the Departments in the Museum were independent, and were         normally advised rather than directed by the Director. This meant that         apart from occasional visits by the Director or a Trustee and an annual         meeting at which the Keeper presented his report to the Trustees, a Department         was left to itself. The then Keeper of the Greek and Roman Department         was seriously ill and had been away for some time; his senior Assistant         Keeper, though a fine scholar, preferred to read books in the Departmental         Library rather than to make a round of inspection that would include the         mason's shop.

Few post-War scholars had shown         an interest in the episode and fewer still in its material consequences         for the sculpture. St Clair, therefore, broke new ground by quoting <em>verbatim</em>         and at length the Museum's own files. The Museum provided full access         to its papers as well as curatorial advice on the sculptures and was unprepared         for the violence of St Clair's reaction. His account, as one reviewer         remarked, deviated from his previous dispassionate approach towards his         subject and had 'the disconcerting effect of changing the whole direction         of the original book.'(102) Instead of dealing with the cleaning in the         same even tone that had controlled the rest of his account of the Elgin         Marbles, St Clair attacked the Museum. He argued that, through a failure         of discipline in the 1930s and what he claimed was a cover up then and         since, the British Museum's 'stewardship' of the Marbles was, as he put         it in the closing paragraph of his book, a 'cynical sham'. The reviewer         for <em>IJCP </em>remarked upon the change:(103)</font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><br wp="BR2">        </font> </p>      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><em>'Having devoted         the bulk of his book to arguing that the Ottomans ultimately granted Elgin         legal title to the marbles, which in turn permitted Elgin to transfer         good title to the British government, St Clair concludes his book by stating         that the ''British claim to a trusteeship has been forfeited''. St Clair         never explains when, in his mind, the museum's possession of the marbles         was converted from one of ownership to one of trusteeship, or in what         way the improper cleaning and the cover-up constituted such a violation         of the trustee's </em>[sic<em>.</em>]<em> responsibility as to warrant         forfeiture.'</em></font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><br wp="BR2">        </font> </p>      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">St Clair's 'stewardship'         was then a straw man, set up so that he could knock it down. The Museum         had never made such a claim of infallibility in its record of curatorship.         Its position has always been that if Lord Elgin had not acted as he did,         and if the sculptures had not come to the Museum when they did, they would         not survive as they do. The <em>TLS </em>reviewer saw through St Clair's         device:</font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><br wp="BR1">        </font> </p>      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">'<em>St Clair is right         to publicize this incident (if nothing else, it is a warning about the         irresponsible power of strong-minded millionaires.)

The Museum         paid the price for it at the time with a major press scandal and it has         been talked of as an embarrassment ever since. Sixty years on, with all         the principal players dead, what seemed most needed was a reasoned assessment         of what actually had happened in the 1930s and what the implications were         for the sculptures themselves. Instead, St Clair's attack, with its frequent         misreading of documents and gross exaggeration of the consequences for         the sculpture, generated another press scandal, further muddying the waters.(104)         The Museum decided, therefore, to reclaim possession of the subject, which         with hindsight it should have done sooner. It held a conference, inviting         an internationally distinguished panel of advisers and speakers, amongst         whom St Clair was one. On the eve of the conference, however, St Clair         produced a second publication, too late for proper consideration at that         event.(105) This maintains the polemical tone of his previous account,         but the number of errors and the misrepresentations rise in proportion         to its greater length and the expanded range of disciplines it attempts         to cover. As this article now represents a substantial element in the         bibliography of the Elgin Marbles as a cultural property issue, and will         certainly mislead readers without expert knowledge, the present author         has prepared for publication elsewhere a corrigenda of some of St Clair's         salient errors.</font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><br wp="BR1">        </font> </p>      <p><font color="#000066"><b><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">Internal         British Museum Memoranda</font></b></font></p>      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In addition to these         published reports, mention should also be made of two internal Museum         Memoranda.The first is marked <u>Strictly Confidential</u> and was drawn         up anonymously as a briefing document for the Trustees at the time of         the opening of the Duveen Galleries in June 1962, following repair of         war-time damage.

As to the method of display, it may be mentioned         that, like the British Museum, both the Acropolis Museum in Athens and         the Louvre exhibit their sections of the Parthenon frieze at eye level.<br>        </font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> </font> </p>      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> In early 1939, rumours         were heard of serious damage caused to the Elgin Marbles during cleaning         prior to their being moved into the Duveen Gallery newly built to house         them. These rumours were dispelled by a statement by the Trustees, published         in The Times on 18th May, 1939, which ran as follows.'

Variations         in the colour of the Marbles were the result of weathering during their         long life before they were brought to England, and had nothing to do with         cleaning at this or any other time. The approved method of cleaning which         had been introduced on the advice of the Museum Laboratory in 1932, consisted         in the use of a neutral solution of medicinal soft-soap and ammonia with         distilled water. Before this date, ordinary water had been used for cleaning.         </font></p>      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Holcombe, foreman         mason in charge of the controversial cleaning operations, stated in the         press that he had used a blunt copper tool "to get off some of the dirtier         spots", but that the tool was softer than marble and no harm had come         to the sculptures so treated. (There is no truth in the accusation, repeated         as recently as May 1961, that acid was used in cleaning the Marbles).         Holcombe also said he had used the same tools for cleaning marble under         four directors (i.e. for more than 30 years), and had used them on the         Elgin marbles for 15 months.Considerable public concern was expressed         at the time, notably by Jacob Epstein and it was alleged that the surface         of the marble had been seriously affected. The exact extent of the damage         cannot now be determined. Disciplinary action was taken by the Trustees         against certain officials concerned in the cleaning incident and the then         Keeper of the Department of Greek and Roman Antiquities resigned shortly         afterwards on grounds of ill-health.'<br>        </font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> </font> </p>      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The second internal         memorandum was sent by Brian Cook, Keeper of Greek and Roman Antiquities         to Jean Rankine, Deputy Director and dated 30 August 1983. Earlier that         summer several events had occurred in relation to the ongoing campaign         for the restitution of the Elgin Marbles, including the much publicised         visit of Melina Mercouri to the Museum in May. In the wake of these events,         Cook drew up a report headed, <em>Notes for updating the brief on the         Parthenon Sculptures</em> in which he recorded the principal occurrences.         He added a further note entitled <em>Overcleaning of the Elgin Marbles</em>:</font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><br wp="BR2">        </font> </p>      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> 'Since detailed reports         appeared in many newspapers at the time and since the Museum's records         of the incident are available under the 30-year rule, there can be no         question of fudging the issue. The essential facts are that the Departmental         Mason (Arthur Holcombe) and labourers working under his charge used a         copper tool to remove some persistent marks from the surface of some of         the Marbles, including traces of the gold and yellow 'patination' that         Pentelic marble acquires when exposed to the air for long periods. This         was done without the authority or even the knowledge of the Keeper or         Assistant Keeper. The facts were brought to light by the sculptor Jacob         Epstein who stated that the cleaning had been going on for some 15 months.         The Museum stopped the unauthorised work at once. Holcombe, who was 72,         was sent into retirement on pension at three weeks' notice. The Keeper         (F.N. Pryce) went into early retirement, alledgedly on grounds of ill         health, and R. Hinks (AK) resigned to join the Warburg Institute. At the         same time the Director claimed that there was no connection between their         departures and the overcleaning, but since the connection was admitted         in the House of Commons there is no point in attempting to keep up the         pretence.</font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><br wp="BR2">        </font> </p>      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> The actual extent         of the damage is open to exaggeration (as recently by Tzedakis) (107),         and I recommend that the Trustees should first observe it for themselves         and then decide whether to authorise publicity of the facts. Archaeologists         who wish to consider the question in more detail will look first at the         metopes and frieze: the metopes and cavalcade of the north frieze were         cleaned, the east frieze was not, and the difference is obvious. On the         other hand, a non-specialist may find it difficult to imagine what the         metopes and north frieze were like before cleaning. It would therefore         be worthwhile to look at the east pediment. Most of the figures were untouched         but the lower part of E [sic for G] ('Hebe') was treated on the front.         The line of demarcation is readily visible about half-way up the thighs.         An earlier photograph in the departmental archives (glass negative broken)         shows that 'patination' in the cleaned area was not in fact extensive.</font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><br wp="BR2">        </font> </p>      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> The "plain copper         tool" used for cleaning was formerly kept in the Director's office. I         have never seen it myself, but Denys Haynes once told me that he had done         so. Again it may be worthwhile to discover the implement and consider         whether or not to make it public.</font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><br wp="BR2">        </font> </p>      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> There has been a         persistent rumour that Duveen was responsible for persuading Holcombe         to undertake the work.
