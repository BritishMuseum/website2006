The Museum held an internal Board of Enquiry,         which found evidence of dereliction of duty on the part of two senior         Museum officials and the foreman of masons. All three left the Museum         as a result. Against the advice of some Trustees, the Director Sir John         Forsdyke and the Board Chairman, Lord Macmillan attempted to play down         in public what they privately described as serious damage. The attempt         failed. The affair leaked into the newspapers and a scandal eventually         ensued.</font><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><br wp="BR2">        </font> </p>      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">There have been suggestions         of a continuing cover up. These must be rejected on the basis that the         Press scandal of the day, and frequent and extensive coverage of the episode         since, renders such concealment redundant. That scandal has remained alive,         nevertheless, and the Museum has been accused of contributing to its persistence         by never having published a full account of the episode, nor having made         a proper assessment of how the 'cleaning' affected the sculptures. This         omission is partly attributable to Forsdyke's understatement at the time,         partly to the interruption of the Second World War and partly, it must         be said, to the Museum's own reticence since the incident.</font><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><br wp="BR2">        </font> </p>      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">These papers represent         the fullest record to date of the episode. So far as its own archival         documents are concerned, however, the Museum can give no guarantee that         what was said sixty years ago is reliable evidence for what was actually         done to the sculptures. The Museum held an internal enquiry that was not         independent. The results were not published. The Director of the Museum         said one thing in private and another in public. Although there was talk         of a report on the material consequences of the cleaning, none followed.         Now, sixty years on, the sculptures remain the only reliable witness.</font><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><br wp="BR2">        </font> </p>      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The documents are         not a solid base from which to interpret the cleaning. Perhaps they were         not intended to be such. The Museum was in the 1930s socially a very small         place, with rivalries and petty jealousies rife among its exclusively         male community. At the time of the cleaning, Forsdyke had only recently         been promoted to his Directorship. Formerly he had been Keeper of Greek         and Roman Antiquities. It is said that the decision was made not to go         outside the Museum for a successor to the previous Director, Sir George         Hill, because the major project of the day was Lord Duveen's new gallery         for the Elgin Marbles.(108) It was thought that Forsdyke was peculiarly         well qualified to see this through to completion. In the Museum, it does         not seem to have been a popular appointment, least of all with Forsdyke's         former peers, the Keepers. One of these was Sydney Smith, by all accounts         a difficult Keeper of Egyptian and Assyrian Antiquities (1931-48). He         and Mrs Gulbenkian had been ushered into the gallery, where Forsdyke made         the fateful remark, 'They're coming up rather white, aren't they?' It         must have been a shock to Forsdyke when, in front of a visitor, his old         rival turned on him with the words, 'And I can tell you why . . .'(109)</font><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><br wp="BR2">        </font> </p>      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">One of those who lost         his job as a result of the furore that ensued was the promising young         scholar by the name of Roger Hinks. He died in 1963 after long service         with the British Council. In the excellent edition of Roger Hink's diaries,         John Goldsmith has suggested that Forsdyke's behaviour over the cleaning         episode was less than honourable, and that much of what was said and done         was designed to save his own neck.(110) The inference is that if Forsdyke         were to survive, he had to construct a case against the scapegoats, the         Keeper of Greek and Roman Antiquities, Frederick Pryce and his assistant         Roger Hinks. So it was that what had been going on under Forsdyke's nose         for fifteen months suddenly became a case of gross dereliction of duty         by subordinates in his former Department. 'The damage which has been caused         is obvious and cannot be exaggerated', was the conclusion of the report         of the Trustees' Board of Enquiry. Why then was it not noticed before?         The fact is that both then and since the 'damage' was far from obvious         and has been much exaggerated.</font><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><br wp="BR2">        </font> </p>      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Take, for example,         the highly inflammatory report to the Board of Enquiry by Harold Plenderleith,         who at the time of the cleaning was scientist in charge of the Museum's         laboratory. William St Clair reports a conversation with him in 1997,         shortly before his death, in which Plenderleith recalls that Forsdyke         hated everyone, 'was much feared and was effective in getting his own         way.'(111) Plenderleith also had cause to feel animosity towards his peers,         especially in the Department of Greek and Roman Antiquities. He was a         pioneer of conservation science. In 1932, under pressure from Lord Duveen         to brighten up the Parthenon sculptures and rid them of their accumulated         dirt, the Museum had charged Plenderleith with the task of devising a         safe but effective means of cleaning the sculptures. This he did, and         the sculpture was cleaned with a neutral solution of medicinal soft-soap         and ammonia. At some point, however, the Museum masons, under the charge         of the officers of the Greek and Roman Department, left off Plenderleith's         method and initiated the unauthorised cleaning of their own devising.         Already before the final 'discovery', Plenderleith had intervened when         he saw metal tools being used.(112) But why had he allowed it to continue?         As with Forsdyke, so with Plenderleith, we must ask why, if the cleaning         was as bad as they later claimed it to be, was it allowed to go on for         fifteen months? The sculptures were not kept hidden after they were cleaned,         at least so far as the frieze and metopes are concerned, but were returned         to public view pending their redisplay in Lord Duveen's new gallery.<strong><font color="#CC6600">(<a href="fig1_5.html#fig3">Fig.3</a>)</font></strong>         Why, it must be asked, in the very small world of the British Museum,         was an unauthorised cleaning, the results of which were for all to see,         allowed to continue by the very people who subsequently condemned it?</font><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><br wp="BR2">        </font> </p>      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Plenderleith complained         that sculptures were chipped with copper chisels, the marks then removed         by polishing with a loss of up to a tenth of an inch of surface. If true,         such action would indeed have damaged the sculptures to the extent of         removing important detail in drapery and anatomy. However, as the sculptures         themselves bear out, this was not done. The rubbing of the surface with         a copper tool, although not itself advisable, is not the same as chiselling.         So why did he say it? There was perhaps a degree of personal outrage on         his part against the officers of the Greek and Roman Department for their         having ignored his instructions. This may have distorted his judgement.</font><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><br wp="BR2">        </font> </p>      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In connection with         Plenderleith's testimony, it is interesting to read his correspondence         fifteen years later with Professor Homer A. Thompson of the American School         of Classical Studies in Athens.(113) On 30 May 1953, Thompson proposed         to clean off the historical coatings on the east inner frieze of the Hephaesteum         (Theseum) a sister monument of the Parthenon situated on a hill overlooking         the Athenian Agora. On 1 July Plenderleith replied laying out a range         of possible approved methods. Among them is cited the use of the very         tools which he had condemned in the cleaning of the Parthenon Sculptures:</font><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><br wp="BR2">        </font> </p>      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(2) <u>Chiselling         by wooden wedges</u>: If good results obtained up to a point you could         go one stage further <strong>with a soft copper chisel as used for cleaning         marble gravestones. This has about the same degree of hardness as marble         in Moh's scale.</strong></font><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><br wp="BR2">        </font> </p>      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(3)<u>Abrasives</u>?         Definitely dangerous but possibly justified for removing spots. Sharp         sand, pumice or <strong>carborundum, </strong>applied with plenty of water,         but better to avoid them if possible on sculpture.</font><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><br wp="BR2">        </font> </p>      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Professor Thompson         did avoid them, but went instead for steel chisels and brass brushes!         The cleaning was done between June and September of 1953 by two Greek         workmen under the direction of Miss Alison Frantz.(114) Thompson himself         wrote to Plenderleith:(115)</font><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><br wp="BR2">        </font> </p>      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> 'After experimenting         with implements of wood, bone, copper and brass, we found that light chisels         of steel gave the best results, being both speedier and, where it was         thickest, the deposit flaked off under gentle tapping, but for the most         part it was loosened by the edge of the chisel under pressure applied         by hand. Over much of the background, where the ancient surface tooling         was somewhat rougher, a soft brass brush was used; in these areas no effort         was made to remove the last particles of deposit from the miniature depressions,         particularly since it soon appeared that the thoroughly cleaned figures         stood out more effectively against a slightly off-white ground . . .'</font><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><br wp="BR2">        </font> </p>      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The 1950s cleaning         of the Hephaesteum frieze is a remarkable, but hitherto overlooked event         in the history of conservation.<strong><font color="#CC6600">(<a href="fig21_25.html#fig23">Fig.23-25</a>)</font></strong>         In advising on it, Plenderleith seems himself to have forgotten what he         had said fifteen years earlier in condemnation of the removal of 'spots'         from the Parthenon sculptures using copper chisels and abrasives. By all         the same arguments that condemned the cleaning of the Parthenon sculptures         in the British Museum, the stripping of the 'patinas' from the Hephaesteum         with steel chisels and wire brushes, should not have happened. No criticism         was voiced then, nor since. Let us be clear; the Hephaesteum cleaning         is not mentioned here with the intention of attaching scandal to it. I         wish, however, to demonstrate the degree to which the British Museum incident         has been isolated from similar cases and to ask the question why. The         answer is that interest in the scandal has overshadowed interest in what         actually was done.</font><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><br wp="BR2">        </font> </p>      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Hitherto, those who         have commented upon the episode since the sculptures were re-exhibited         after the War have done so from the point of view of a scandal. Some have         done it privately in their diaries, published posthumously (Hinks, Crawford).         Others have declaimed aloud in the political arena of the debate over         the ownership of the Parthenon sculptures (Hitchens, Tzedakis). Others         still have shouted their protest from the high ground of moral indignation         (Epstein, Brandi, St Clair). This sense of outrage and scandal has obscured         the need for proper assessment of what actually was done. Brandi's account,         for example, is largely composed of rhetoric, while his observations about         the sculpture are more sensation than sense.</font><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><br wp="BR2">        </font> </p>      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">A preoccupation with         scandal has not only obscured what was done in 1937-38, but also what         happened to the sculptures before then. The 1930s cleaning has a broader         context, which to some extent explains it. It is interesting to discover         that modern instigators of public outrage at the Museum's treatment of         the sculptures have their forerunners in such persons as 'Marmor', the         anonymous author of complaints in <em>The Times </em>about the Victorian         scrubbing of them. Nor is the British Museum alone in having a history         of such criticism. In the nineteenth century 'Verax' (J. Morris Moore)         was to the National Gallery what 'Marmor' was to the Museum.(116) It is         also interesting to reflect upon the degree to which criticism of cleaning         the Parthenon sculptures has followed the pattern of controversy over         the cleaning of pictures at the National Gallery. There have been others,         but there were three main periods of controversy, in 1846-53, 1936-7 and         1946-7. Each acted as a prelude to debate over the cleaning of the Parthenon         sculptures: in 1857-8, 1938-9 and 1950.(117) Of the 1936-37 controversy         Philip Hendy writes: 'There has never been anywhere so protracted an argument         over the cleaning of a single picture. It began with an article by the         art critic of the <em>Daily Telegraph</em> published 19 December 1936,         but the resulting correspondence soon spread to <em>The Times</em> and         other newspapers. By March 1937 more than fifty letters and a dozen articles         had been printed, and a broadcast had been made.'(118)</font><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><br wp="BR2">        </font> </p>      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">From this we can deduce         how well primed was the public for the cleaning scandal of the Elgin Marbles         in 1938-39.</font><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><br wp="BR2">        </font> </p>      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The lust for scandal         has continued. The restitution lobby, in particular, has focused its attention         on the cleaning of the Elgin Marbles. Christopher Hitchens is one of those         who has dwelt upon the episode at length as part of the argument for returning         the sculptures to Greece. With a long account of the cleaning, he counters         the claim that 'The marbles are safer in London than they would have been         in Athens', and concludes: 'if there are to be arguments about safety         and conservation, then they must take account of time and chance in London         as well as of time and chance in Athens.'(119) I would agree. Hitchens,         however, fails to apply his own fair principle. In order to balance the         argument, he should have given instances of where the Acropolis sculptures         have suffered in Athens. Architectural sculptures that Lord Elgin did         not remove from the Acropolis -- the Caryatids of the Erechtheum, the         battle friezes of the Temple of Athena Nike, the pedimental sculptures         of the Parthenon and its west Ionic frieze -- have all been damaged by         continued exposure to the weather. The west frieze was only taken down         from the Parthenon in 1993 and now presents a major problem of conservation.         The Nike Temple frieze has only just come down. Its pollution-ravaged         surface compares unfavourably with the casts made of it by Lord Elgin         In her book on the Parthenon pediment sculptures, the Greek archaeologist         Olga Palagia writes of the statues of Kekrops and his daughter: 'B and         C were finally removed from the [west] pediment to the Acropolis Museum         in 1977 after the industrial pollution of modern Athens had wreaked havoc         on their delicate surface.'(120)</font></p>      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> </font> </p>    </td>    <td valign="top" height="173" align="center" colspan="2" width="36"><br>    </td>  </tr>  <tr>     <td rowspan="2" align="center" height="139" colspan="2" width="36">       <p>&nbsp;</p>    </td>  </tr>  <tr> </tr>  <tr>     <td colspan="4" height="41"><img src="images/home8.gif" width="709" height="49" usemap="#Map" border="0"><map name="Map"><area shape="rect" coords="62,26,120,46" href="index.html"><area shape="rect" coords="377,25,696,51" href="8.html"></map></td>  </tr></table></body></html>
