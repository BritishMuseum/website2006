A major press scandal ensued, and at its height there appeared         a newspaper cartoon<a href="fig1_5.html#fig1"> <strong>(Fig. 1)</strong></a>         with the caption: 'Elgin Marbles being spoilt by Cleaning - Epstein',         and underneath, 'Lor, Em, That Mister Epstein is right. They must have         cleaned this bloke with a pick.'. (2) There has been an attempt to revive         this scandal. A photograph appeared at the head of a newspaper article         in June 1998, (3) trailing the third edition of William St Clair's book,         <em>Lord</em> <em>Elgin</em> <em>and</em> <em>the</em> <em>Marbles</em>.         The caption read: 'The point where masons stopped cleaning the horse of         the sun god Helios - and the previous glowing honey colour that they partly         scrubbed off'. Neither Mr St Clair's book, nor the newspaper coverage         of the claims it makes, has done service to clarifying what actually happened         to the sculptures in the 1930s. The horse of Helios does not owe its patchy         appearance to the cleaning, but to natural weathering.</font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><br wp="BR2">        </font> </p>      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The 1930s newspaper         cartoon is funny because it is deliberately misleading. Nevertheless,         it represents a typical reaction to the 1930s cleaning. Fascinated by         the scandal of it, people have tended to make up their own version of         its consequences. There is, and always has been, much loose talk of 'patina'.         Adjectives to describe it like 'warm, rich and glowing' reflect notions         of how the sculptures should be, rather than how they are or were. The         cleaning, we are told, has removed their glow. Contrast this opinion with         that of a journalist writing in <em>The</em> <em>Daily</em> <em>Graphic</em>         when the sculptures went back on show in 1949. He saw them 'glow with         a Mediterranean warmth'.(4) This, it should be noted, was post cleaning,         when others had argued that the sculptures had lost their 'glow'.</font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><br wp="BR2">        </font> </p>      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Everyone has their         own idea of how they think the Marbles should look. Writing in 1857, Michael         Faraday thought them far from glowing and lamented their discolouration         from brown stains and black soot, whereas - or so he believed - sculptures         in Greece and Italy, unaffected by Museum pollution, were white. (5) What         I take Faraday to mean by 'brown stains' are the orange-brown coatings         that can still be seen in places on the surface of the sculptures today.         In 1988 I published a paper with my colleague Andrew Middleton entitled         'Paint on the Parthenon Sculptures', (6) We argued that these coatings         were ancient and artificial, and likely to be the result of paint treatments         applied to the stone in antiquity and afterwards partially weathered off.         They appear where the ancient finish appears to be intact and, where the         surface is weathered, they are missing. There is a dispute as to the origin         of these coatings. The least that may be said is that whether artificial         or natural these coatings are historic. They happened at specific moments         in time and were then affected by weather or damage. They did not re-form         in the areas that were affected by this wear.</font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><br wp="BR2">        </font> </p>      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">A critical question         has to do with the extent to which these coatings survived up until the         1930s. From an examination of the marble surface itself it is possible         to see that they had already largely disappeared even before Elgin's men         set eyes on the sculpture. I estimate that when the sculptures entered         the Museum less than 20% of their overall surface retained its coating,         of which in the 1930s about half was removed. The surface of the sculptures         as you see it today is, without question, largely the product of weathering         before they entered the Museum.</font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><br wp="BR2">        </font> </p>      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">This is not to deny         that weathered and some unweathered surfaces underwent further change         as a result of the cleaning of the 1930s and, indeed, earlier. But natural         weathering is by far the single most important factor determining the         surface and colour of the sculptures as we see them today. It is important         to state this at the outset, so as to get the 1930s cleaning into perspective.         In 1998 it was very surprising to read Mr St Clair's assertion to the         contrary, namely that 'when the Elgin Marbles were transferred to the         British Museum in 1816, their ancient patina was still largely intact'.         (7) Up to the 1930s the sculptures were, he says, a 'warm brown'. (8)         Earlier in his account we read that 'in Elgin's day [they] were covered         with a patina, in some places smooth, in others scaly, in a rich mixture         of white, brown, orange and occasional black, the result of long exposure         to the open air'. (9) This premise has been the very foundation of his         argument and yet no scientific evidence is given to demonstrate it. Watercolour         drawings and oil paintings are offered instead as literal representations         of how the sculptures once were. We read that in Archibald Archer's oil         painting of the Elgin Room the sculptures are 'honey-coloured'. (10) In         fact, under fuliginous layers of old varnish, they are a pale cream, which         is probably the colour Archer thought they should be, rather than what         they were. <strong><a href="fig1_5.html#fig2">(Fig.2)</a></strong> St         Clair argues, however, that the sculptures were that colour actually.         If so, his case for their having been covered in the brown coating is         already destroyed. Lord Leighton's self-portrait now in the Uffizi is         cited as evidence for the original colour of the Parthenon Frieze (11).         But when this picture was painted in 1880, it is much more likely that         Lord Leighton had in mind the casts installed in the walls of his own         studio (12).</font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><br wp="BR1">        </font> </p>      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Why, we must ask ourselves,         has it been so difficult, both in the 1930s, and since, for people to         give an accurate report of the cleaning? It is not as if the sculptures         have been hidden from view. St Clair is mistaken when he writes: 'As the         Duveen gallery was being built . . . the Marbles were mostly not on public         view'. (13). Photographs of the day and the Keeper's reports to the Trustees         show that, once they had been cleaned on a piecemeal basis, the sculptures         were returned to the gallery. There we see the cleaned ones looking white         against the uncleaned sculptures and the darkened casts.<a href="fig1_5.html#fig3">(<strong>Fig.3)</strong></a>         Nor, with the exception of their removal for safety during and after the         Second World War, have the sculptures been hidden from view since their         cleaning. They have been on show since 1949 and, if the damage is obvious,         why was it so little remarked upon? Many published references have been         made to the 1930s cleaning,(14) but the primary motive of these accounts         has been a lust for scandal and, latterly, the campaign for the return         of the Elgin Marbles to Greece. Scandal mongering and politics have not         provided a healthy climate in which to foster a truthful assessment of         what actually was done to the sculptures.<br wp="BR2">        </font> </p>      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">It is ironic that         already in 1939, the last word in the pre-War press coverage tried to         move the discussion forward. On 9 June an anonymous correspondent to <em>The</em>         <em>Manchester</em> <em>Guardian</em> wrote: 'The ultimate question at         the bottom of the Elgin Marbles controversy is what is meant by the magic         word "patina". No one denies that some of the marbles have been pretty         drastically cleaned, in some cases by methods of which no expert could         possibly approve . . . Folk who like to think they have scented out a         first-rate scandal have not been slow to move and a good deal has been         said about it, including the suggestion that the Marbles have been "ruined".         . . . But what, in fact, has happened?'(15)</font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><br wp="BR2">        </font> </p>      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Sixty years on, that         question has yet to be answered. St Clair claims 'all the metopes, 80         or 90 per cent of the frieze, and about half the pedimental sculptures         of the Parthenon were damaged by over cleaning at some time before the         halt was called.'(16) 'The most vivid evidence', he says, 'for the extent         of the damage is in the three pieces which were still being cleaned when         Sir John Forsdyke discovered what was going on in September 1938, the         Helios, the head of Selene's horse and the Iris.'(17) These are the ones         mentioned in the Board of Enquiry's Report. This internal affair was concocted         by Sir John Forsdyke, the Museum's Director, to create scapegoats for         what was ultimately his responsibility. It is unwise to depend upon it         as a source for what actually was done. The Board's phrase: 'the damage         is obvious and cannot be exaggerated', is often quoted, but it seems anything         but obvious and has been much exaggerated.</font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><br wp="BR2">        </font> </p>      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">We read that most         of the smaller sculptures of the west pediment were 'stripped'. Of the         Iris St Clair writes: 'The white left leg, where a patch of residual patina         had not yet been removed when the halt was called, looks as if it had         been smeared in dog dirt.'(18) The hyperbole is embarrassing enough, but         it is even more so, when we learn that he is describing entirely the wrong         statue. He should have been looking, as was pointed out to him in 1998,         not at this figure from the west pediment but another piece from the east         pediment. In spite of St Clair's claims to the contrary, only east pediment         pieces were rubbed and these were the Helios, the back of his two horses'         heads, the drapery of Iris and the back of the head of the horse of Selene.</font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><br wp="BR1">        </font> </p>      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">So what in fact did         happen to these and other sculptures?
