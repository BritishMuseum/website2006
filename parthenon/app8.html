The Committee, having considered the         letter, resolved to accept as from 28 February 1939 the resignation thereby         tendered by Mr. Hinks, and to recommend to the General Board that in view         of the statements made in the letter and of Mr. Hinks' resignation, the         resolution of the General Board passed on 10 December 1938 reducing Mr         Hinks 10 years in seniority and pay be rescinded in so far as regards         that reduction. The Committee also resolved that, pending the decision         of the General Board, no reduction be made in the salary payable to Mr.         Hinks.</font></p></td>    <td valign="top" height="173" align="center" colspan="2" width="36"><br>    </td>  </tr>  <tr>     <td rowspan="2" align="center" height="139" colspan="2" width="36">       <p>&nbsp;</p>    </td>  </tr>  <tr> </tr>  <tr>     <td colspan="4" height="41"><img src="images/home9.gif" width="709" height="49" usemap="#Map" border="0"><map name="Map"><area shape="rect" coords="270,26,390,43" href="appendices.html"><area shape="rect" coords="400,26,522,44" href="fig1_5.html"><area shape="rect" coords="536,26,630,44" href="bio.html"><area shape="rect" coords="643,27,699,43" href="notes.html"><area shape="rect" coords="68,19,125,57" href="index.html"></map></td>  </tr></table></body></html>
