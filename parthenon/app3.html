On the 16<sup>th</sup> of September Mr. Pryce left         the Museum on short holiday leave. The three pieces of sculpture were         then in their proper places in the Elgin Room. Before he went away Mr.         Pryce gave no instructions either to Mr. Hinks, who took charge in his         absence, or to anyone else with regard to either moving the sculptures         or cleaning them beyond a direction to Holcombe to prepare a mounting         for the Iris figure which involved its removal from the pedestal. The         Director informed the Board that he had previously reminded Mr. Pryce         that this figure must not even be washed without the authority of Dr.         Plenderleith in view of the precarious condition of its surface. While         Mr Pryce was absent it came to the notice of the Director on the evening         of Thursday, 22<sup>nd</sup> September, that tools had been used in the         cleaning of the Parthenon sculptures. He instructed Mr. Hinks on the morning         of 23<sup>rd</sup> September to see that improper methods were not being         used. On Sunday, 25<sup>th</sup> September, the Director happened to have         occasion to pass through the basement of the Department. He was surprised         to find there the Helios group in process of cleaning. On the bench he         observed a number of copper tools and a piece of coarse carborundum, and         from the appearance of the sculptures he at once saw that tools had been         used on the sculptures. On Monday morning, 26<sup>th</sup> September,         the Iris was found by Mr. Hinks to be undergoing similar treatment in         an annex of the new Duveen Gallery, and the Selene horse's head in the         Foreman Mason's workshop.</font></p>      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><br wp="BR1">        <br wp="BR2">        </font></p>      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Although Holcombe         denied that he had used any copper tool in cleaning the horse's head,         which he dealt with himself personally, the Board are satisfied that copper         tools were used by Holcombe and the labourers under him in cleaning all         the three pieces of sculpture in question. Holcombe admitted that apart         from the instruction to prepare a mounting for the Iris figure he had         received no specific instructions from the Keeper or the Assistant Keeper         either to remove or to clean the sculptures. He appears to have assumed         that he was at liberty to proceed at his own hand with the process of         removing and cleaning. He apparently had obtained some strips or rods         of copper from the store and had fashioned those into tools of various         shapes by flattening and sharpening the ends. He said that he had used         similar tools on other occasions for cleaning marble and he apparently         regarded himself as entitled to use them on the Parthenon sculptures.         No effort was made to conceal them and they were lying exposed to full         view on the bench when the Director first observed them.</font></p>      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><br wp="BR1">        <br wp="BR2">        </font></p>      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In the course of the         evidence given by Holcombe and the labourers it emerged that they had         used tools in cleaning the metopes and frieze on which they had previously         been engaged for some time. The Board did not think it to be within their         duty to make a detailed examination of the metopes and frieze with a view         to ascertaining the extent of the damage done, but they were impressed         by the fact that such improper methods of cleaning had been allowed to         be in operation over so long a period.</font></p>      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><br wp="BR1">        <br wp="BR2">        </font></p>      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">While the damage to         the sculptures was directly occasioned by the unauthorised actions of         Holcombe, it is impossible to acquit the Keeper and the Assistant Keeper         of serious dereliction of duty. Their main responsibility is the preservation         and protection of the valuable works of art committed to their care. Nevertheless,         owing to absence of direction and to inefficiency of supervision in the         Department, Holcombe was able to remove the Helios group and the Selene         horse's head, and to undertake the cleaning of all the three sculptures         in question at his own hand without the knowledge of either the Keeper         or the Assistant Keeper who was in charge of the Department at the time.         This can only be taken as indicating a most unfortunate slackness and         want of system in the administration of the Department.</font></p>      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><br wp="BR1">        <br wp="BR2">        </font></p>      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In the case of Mr.         Pryce, it is true that he had in the course of this year been suffering         from ill health necessitating his absence from work for two periods, and         also that he was on holiday leave when the particular unauthorised actings         of Holcombe with the Pediment sculptures took place. But the work of cleaning         the Parthenon sculptures was a long and delicate process, calling for         a definite programme and careful and systematic supervision. It was the         duty of Mr Pryce to see to these matters. It should have been made clear         to the staff that no piece of sculpture must be removed and no piece of         sculpture must be cleaned without specific orders from Mr. Pryce himself,         or, in his absence, his deputy. No such step was taken, with the result         that Holcombe considered himself entitled to remove the Helios group and         the Selene horse and to start to clean those two pieces and the Iris figure         on his own initiative. The necessity for specific instructions with regard         to the cleaning of each individual piece was all the more imperative by         reason of the fact that the condition of the sculptures varies considerably         and special care was necessary in certain cases, for example, the Iris         figure. Mr. Pryce informed us that when the cleaning first began he gave         instructions to Holcombe that it was only to be done according to the         approved methods. But it was his duty to see that these instructions were         being carried out. In this duty he failed, with the result that tools         were improperly used in cleaning the metopes and the frieze without his         ever knowing it. The improper practice thus begun was continued in the         case of the Pediment sculptures during Mr. Pryce's absence. But the fact         that he was absent on that occasion does not free him from responsibility         for the damage done to these sculptures since if he had exercised proper         supervision when the cleaning of the metopes first began the practice         would have been stopped at the very beginning. Moreover, when he left         for his holiday he ought to have given proper instructions to his deputy,         Mr. Hinks, with regard to continuing the work of cleaning the sculptures,         but he failed to do so. Mr. Pryce's neglect of his duties is all the more         serious in view of the fact that he had been Deputy Keeper since 27<sup>th</sup>         November, 1934, and Keeper since 25<sup>th</sup> June, 1936, and had had         the management of the Sculpture Galleries and workshops from 1925 to 1932,         during Mr. Walters' Keepership, and was presumably conversant with the         proper procedure to be observed in connection with the moving and cleaning         of the sculptures under his charge. When questioned as to how this occurrence         could have taken place if there had been proper supervision Mr. Pryce         was unable to answer, and when asked as to what steps should be taken         to prevent the possibility of the recurrence of such an incident he exhibited         little faculty of resourceful suggestion.</font></p>      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Statement in answer         to the charge of neglect of duty</font></p>      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><br wp="BR1">        <br wp="BR2">        </font></p>      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Mr. F.

I would emphasise         that I had no intention of beginning the washing of the pedimental figures         at the period under review. Other and urgent work was before us (in the         Third Graeco-Roman Room, which had begun before I returned). Further,         I wished the washing of the pediments to be the last of the Elgin Room         activities, not only that the marbles might be freshly cleaned for the         opening, but because much labour would be saved if, after washing, these         heavy masses could be transferred directly to their new mounts. February         1939 seemed to me the suitable date on which to begin the washing. It         was for this reason that I had not yet consulted Dr. Plenderleith as to         how far we should wash, and for the same reason I said nothing about washing         to Mr. Hinks when I handed over to him.</font></p>      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><br wp="BR1">        <br wp="BR2">        </font></p>      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">2. The instructions         I gave Holcombe on leaving were to take down the Iris, prepare its mounting,         and set it up in the new gallery. This was at Lord Duveen's request conveyed         through the Director. I explained the matter fully to Mr. Hinks, emphasising         that he should personally check the position of the mount. Holcombe moved         the Iris half-way, then deviated from his instructions. The job would         have occupied the men until they were wanted elsewhere; had it been finished         more quickly, there are always various jobs of a routine nature on which         the men can be usefully employed. There was no necessity to begin washing,         to find employment for the men.</font></p>      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><br wp="BR1">        <br wp="BR2">        </font></p>      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">3. The standing instruction         in the Department is that no sculpture is moved without express authority.         Holcombe had not acted without authority in the past and I had no reason         to anticipate that he would act on impulse in my absence.</font></p>      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><br wp="BR1">        <br wp="BR2">        </font></p>      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">4. When the washing         began, I asked Holcombe if he and the men understood the proper process,         and he replied in the affirmative. At the outset I spent much time with         the men, and the washing whenever I was present was being done in accordance         with regulation. I have reexamined the slabs of the frieze which were         first washed (in the S.W. angle of the Elgin Room), and can see no trace         of the use of copper tools. On this point I consulted Dr. Plenderleith         who, I believe, concurs. It would appear then that the proper process         was known to the men and at first followed by them, and that I had reason         for being satisfied on this point. Subsequently I spent less time in the         workshop, but when on duty I regularly visited the men daily. I never         caught them in the use of unauthorised tools. There was of course a long         period in the spring of this year when washing was in progress and when         I was absent or under medical treatment.</font></p>      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><br wp="BR1">        <br wp="BR2">        </font></p>      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">F.
