The Board beg to         refer to their previous Interim Report of 7<sup>th</sup> November 1938         which was laid before the Standing Committee of the Trustees at their         Meeting on 12<sup>th</sup> November 1938. Prior to that Meeting the passages         of the Board's Interim Report attributing neglect of duty to Mr. Pryce         and Mr. Hinks were communicated to them and they each submitted a written         statement in answer. These statements were laid before the Meeting of         the Standing Committee along with the Board's Interim Report, and Mr .Pryce         and Mr. Hinks were each called in separately and afforded an opportunity,         of which they availed themselves, of supplementing their written statements         and answering questions addresed to them by members of the Committee and         the Director.</font></p>      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><br wp="BR1">        <br wp="BR2">        </font></p>      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">2. The Committee,         having taken into consideration the Board's Interim Report, the written         statements by Mr. Pryce and Mr. Hinks and the results of the interviews,         resolved in terms of the following extract from the Minutes of the Meeting:-</font></p>      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><br wp="BR1">        <br wp="BR2">        </font></p>      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Committee accepted         the Interim Report of the Board of Enquiry, and requested the Board to         meet at 4.15 p.m. on November 15<sup>th</sup> in order to complete its         enquiry and to make recommendations particularly in regard to the disciplinary         action to be taken and the publication of the facts.</font></p>      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><br wp="BR1">        <br wp="BR2">        </font></p>      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">3. The Board held         a fourth meeting on the 15<sup>th</sup> of November 1938 at which all         the members were present except Sir Charles Peers who communicated his         views in a letter to Lord Macmillan of 14<sup>th</sup> November. The Board         examined J. F. Sinclair and A. E. Simenton, two of the labourers who had         been engaged in the cleaning of the sculptures; and A. S. Holcombe, the         Foreman Mason, was recalled and further examined. Sinclair stated that         he had used copper tools in cleaning the Parthenon marbles since June         1937. He also stated that Daniel, the foreman employed by Lord Duveen,         had pointed out to him that one of the slabs, chosen for Lord Duveen to         show in his new gallery, was not white enough and that Holcombe had previously         told him to see if he could brighten it up. The slab was in consequence         recleaned. Daniel commended him for getting it whiter. The incident is         of importance only as showing that Holcombe and Sinclair and presumably         the other workmen were aware of Daniel's desire that the sculptures should         be made as clean and white as possible for Lord Duveen.</font></p>      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><br wp="BR1">        <br wp="BR2">        </font></p>      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">4. The Board learned         from Holcombe, Sinclair and Simenton that a sum of two or three pounds         had been given by Daniel to Holcombe to be divided among himself and the         workmen after they had performed some heavy work in moving some of the         sculptures, and that this sum was shared among them. The Board do not         associate this payment with the cleaning operations, except in so far         as it was calculated to promote the readiness of Holcombe and the workmen         to comply with Daniel's wishes.</font></p>      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><br wp="BR1">        <br wp="BR2">        </font></p>      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">5. The Board have         investigated the position with regard to the dismissal of Keepers and         Assistant Keepers of Departments. These officers are appointed by the         three Principal Trustees, viz., the Archbishop of Canterbury, the Lord         Chancellor and the Speaker of the House of Commons, under the powers conferred         by the statute 26 Geo.II.c.22 S.17. The form of appointment in use declares         that the appointment is "subject to and until a removal from the said         employment and service by the Principal Trustees of the British Museum         for the time being, without prejudice to the power of removal for misbehaviour         or neglect of duty vested in the Trustees of the British Museum by Section         XV of the Act of Parliament of 26 George II, cap.xxii and subject to the         provisions of the Acts of Parliament and the Orders in Council governing         the retirements and superannuations of the Civil Service." Section XV         of the Act provides that the Trustees "shall and may at their pleasure...suspend         or remove...for misbehaviour or neglect of duty" any officer appointed         by the Principal Trustees. As regards the powers of the Standing Committee,         the existing Statutes and Rules in Chapter I paragraph 7 direct the Committee         to "inquire as often as they think fit into the conduct of the Officers         ... of the Museum and give directions accordingly", but they do not confer         on the Committee any power to dismiss or remove Officers.</font></p>      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><br wp="BR1">        <br wp="BR2">        </font></p>      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">6. The Board have         given anxious consideration to the question of the disciplinary action         to be taken in the cases of Mr. Pryce and Mr. Hinks. After fully discussing         the matter (without the presence of the Director) they have come to the         conclusion that the interests of the Museum require that Mr. Pryce and         Mr. Hinks be no longer retained on the staff of the Museum. As to the         precise form which the termination of their appointments should take the         Board are of opinion that this is a matter to be determined by the Trustees.         The possible courses are (1) that they be permitted to resign; (2) that         they be removed from office on the ground of their inability to discharge         efficiently the duties of their offices; (3) that they be dismissed for         neglect of duty. In the last mentioned case no retiring allowance would         be granted; in the second case the Treasury have a discretion to grant         a retiring allowance (Superannuation Act, 1887, sections 2 and 9); and         in the first case presumably some retiring allowance would be payable         if the resignation were on the ground of health, but not otherwise. The         Treasury authorities, who have been unofficially consulted, have expressed         a desire that they should be informed beforehand as to the disciplinary         action to be taken.</font></p>      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><br wp="BR1">        <br wp="BR2">        </font></p>      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">7. The Board accordingly         recommend that the Trustees in conjunction with the Principal Trustees         at the Meeting of the Trustees to be held on the 10<sup>th</sup> of December         1938 terminate the appointments of Mr. Pryce and Mr. Hinks in such manner         as may be deemed appropriate; and they suggest that Sir James Rae, K.C.B.,         K. B.E. of the Treasury be invited to be in attendance for the purpose         of consultation, if thought desirable.</font></p>      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><br wp="BR1">        <br wp="BR2">        </font></p>      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">8. As regards the         question of apprising the public of what has occurred the Board are of         opinion that a public statement need not be made. They have learned with         satisfaction that remedial measures applied by the Director and Dr. Plenderleith         have mitigated to a considerable extent the evidence of the treatment         which the three pediment-sculptures have received so far as the eye of         the general public is concerned but to the expert the damage will remain         discernible. In these circumstances the Board do not recommend any communication         to the Press on the subject.</font></p>      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><br wp="BR1">        <br wp="BR2">        </font></p>      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">British Museum </font></p>      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">November, 1938.</font></p></td>    <td valign="top" height="173" align="center" colspan="2" width="36"><br>    </td>  </tr>  <tr>     <td rowspan="2" align="center" height="139" colspan="2" width="36">       <p>&nbsp;</p>    </td>  </tr>  <tr> </tr>  <tr>     <td colspan="4" height="41"><img src="images/home9.gif" width="709" height="49" usemap="#Map" border="0"><map name="Map"><area shape="rect" coords="270,26,390,43" href="appendices.html"><area shape="rect" coords="400,26,522,44" href="fig1_5.html"><area shape="rect" coords="536,26,630,44" href="bio.html"><area shape="rect" coords="643,27,699,43" href="notes.html"><area shape="rect" coords="68,19,125,57" href="index.html"></map></td>  </tr></table></body></html>
