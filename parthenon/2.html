Like the objects in any old house       they have been moved and rearranged. The sculptures have had their fractures       filled with cement, and had these fillings taken away again. They have been       drilled and cut to attach joining fragments and casts. They were sandbagged       in the First World War, and in the Second they were removed to the underground       tunnels of the Aldwych Tube Station. They have been allowed to get dirty       and they have been over-cleaned.(19)<br>        </font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> </font> </p>      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The notorious cleaning         of the sculptures of the Parthenon in 1937-8 can only be understood in         the context of what went before. By 1937 the sculptures had already been         displayed in England for a century and more, first in Lord Elgin's two         makeshift 'museums' (20) and after February 1817 in the British Museum.         Here, the sculptures went first into a temporary building designed by         Robert Smirke and erected in the grounds of old Montagu House. In 1832         they were removed to the gallery that formed a part of the new Greek Revival         building designed by Robert Smirke.(21) Already within one generation,         therefore, the sculptures had undergone no less than four separate changes         of location. Even then their arrangement did not stand still.</font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><br wp="BR2">        </font> </p>      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The remainder of the         19th and the early part of the 20<sup>th</sup> century saw many attempts         at reconciling the conflicting status of the sculpture as, on the one         hand, the finest ancient artworks known to man, and, on the other, component         parts of an original architectural complex.(22) Treated as star pieces         of ancient art, the pediment sculpture and the metopes fitted into the         frame of the neoclassical museum gallery with relative ease. The great         length of the frieze, however, together with the fact that it was designed         originally for four sides of the exterior of a building, made it less         adaptable to the circumstances of museum display. There was to be almost         constant experiment in the arrangement and rearrangement of the frieze,         not least to accommodate the many additions of newly discovered fragments.         Sometimes these were in the actual marble, but usually the addition was         made in the form of a plaster cast of the original. Rearrangement was         also occasioned by advances in the knowledge of the proper sequence of         the frieze blocks as fixed on the Parthenon itself. The Elgin Room of         the British Museum became the great laboratory of experiment in the search         for an ever better understanding of the sculptures and for better ways         of displaying them.</font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><br wp="BR1">        </font> </p>      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">It was not only the         frieze that received plaster additions. Attachments were also made to         the metopes by drilling holes into the broken areas. As for the pediment         sculptures, by the 1920s not only were casts added to them but also, under         Arthur Hamilton Smith, an explicit indication was given of the triangular         frame of the architecture that once surrounded them.(23) Perhaps more         than any Museum curator before him, Smith was committed to the principal         that the sculptures could only be made intelligible if explicit reference         were made to their original architectural context, and if deficiencies         in the sculptures themselves were made up by the use of plaster casts.         He raised his voice in opposition, therefore, to a report submitted to         the Royal Commission on Museums and Art Galleries of 1928 that proposed         to sweep all this away.(24) In the radical new spirit of post Great War         Britain, the Elgin Room seemed to some critics cluttered and in need of         purging. Donald Robertson, John Beazley and Bernard Ashmole reported as         follows:</font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><br wp="BR2">        </font> </p>      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> 'The Parthenon Marbles,         being the greatest body of original Greek sculpture in existence, and         unique monuments of its first maturity, are primarily works of art. Their         former decorative function as architectural ornaments, and their present         educational use as illustrations of mythical and historical events in         ancient Greece, are by comparison accidental and trivial interests, which         can indeed be better served by casts.'(25)</font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><br wp="BR2">        </font> </p>      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">This bold manifesto         left the reader in no doubt as to where its authors stood in the division         of opinion between those who saw the sculptures as art and those who regarded         them as archaeology. It had immediate effect in attracting a pledge of         funds from Sir Joseph Duveen for a new gallery to house the sculptures.         It was in the course of preparing them for exhibition in this new gallery         that the infamous cleaning occurred. There had, however, been other controversial         cleanings before this one.</font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><br wp="BR1">        </font> </p>      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Many of the arguments         that are heard today for or against the conservation of ancient artworks         were rehearsed in the nineteenth century around the case of the Elgin         Marbles.(26) Even before they came to the Museum, Lord Elgin aroused dissent         with his proposals for having his Marbles restored in the Italian manner.(27)         He did not in the end execute them, but in 1811 John Henning, the sculptor,         intervened when Joseph Nollekens' men were about to start scouring the         sculptures with dilute sulphuric acid and water.(28) The practice had         been advised by Nollekens himself, who had learned his trade from Bartolomeo         Cavaceppi and other restorers of ancient sculpture in Rome, where preserving         original surfaces mattered less than achieving a complete object for the         Grand Tour market.(29) Henning had been prompted to recall the incident         when, in 1845, he had seen the Lycian sculptures, then newly arrived in         the British Museum, being washed with acid and water, and had tactfully         expressed his disapproval.(30)</font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><br wp="BR1">        </font> </p>      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The sculptures were         presumably washed by some means in Elgin's possession. They must have         been washed again in 1816, when casts were made of them by the sculptor         Richard Westmacott,(31) and washed again around 1836-7, when they were         moulded for the second and last time.(32) Already in 1830 Michael Faraday         and Richard Westmacott had been consulted about the application of a wash         to prevent 'decomposition' of the surface of some sculptures that were         perceived to be suffering from 'exposure to the air'. (33) However, it         was in 1845 that the Museum seems to have become especially sensitive         to the surface condition of its sculptures. The Trustees attention was         drawn to the fact that the manner of heating the galleries by coal-fired         stoves was responsible for a great quantity of dust.(34) There was, besides,         another cause, and perhaps a far greater menace, namely the deterioration         of the London air by the increase of smoke emissions from coal-fires serving         the city's ever growing population. The antiquities, it was observed,         including the Elgin Marbles, 'are daily becoming more deteriorated by         exposure to the London atmosphere, its smoke and dirt and the alterations         of heated and damp air. A single inspection of them and comparison of         the present state with that in which they were brought to England, or         that of late importations from Athens are quite sufficient to confirm         the danger: and from the frequent ablutions which are necessary to clear         them of the dirt, but which materially affect the surface of the marble,         it is to be appreciated that at the end of a century or less they may         be irreparably injured.'(35)</font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><br wp="BR1">        </font> </p>      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">These warnings were         given by W. R. Hamilton, Lord Elgin's former agent and afterwards an influential         Trustee of the Museum. They formed part of an ongoing discussion about         whether the Museum collections as then constituted were rationally composed         and whether they should be separated out. One possibility was for detaching         the Elgin Marbles and sending them out of London into the clean air of         the country. Such was the concern over the threat to London's artworks         that the Site Commission for the National Gallery's new building requested         permission for Michael Faraday to examine the surface of sculptures in         the British Museum to ascertain the effects of smoke and dust. The intention         was to determine where, or where not, to found the new repository of the         nation's collection of pictures.(36) The Museum was also much interested         in Faraday's responses and its Trustees discussed the text of a letter         addressed by him to the Dean of St Paul's Cathedral. It was considered         important enough to be printed up as a Memorandum.

The surface of the marbles is in general rough, as if corroded;         only a very few specimens present the polish of finished marble: many         have a dead surface; many are honeycombed, in a fine degree, more or less;         or have shivered broken surfaces, calculated to hold dirt mechanically.</font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><br wp="BR2">        </font> </p>      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> I found the body         of the marble beneath the surface white. I found very few places where         the discoloration seemed to be produced by a stain penetrating the real         body of the unchanged or unbroken marble. Almost everywhere it appeared         to be due to dirt (arising from dust, smoke, soot, etc.) held, mechanically,         by the rough and fissured surface of the stone.</font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><br wp="BR1">        </font> </p>      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> The application of         water, applied by a sponge or soft cloth, removed the coarsest dirt, but         did not much enlighten the general dark tint. The addition of rubbing,         either by the finger, or a cork, or soft brushes, improved the colour,         but still left it far below that of the fresh fracture. The use of a fine         gritty powder, with the water and rubbing, though it more quickly removed         the upper dirt, left much imbedded in the cellular surface of the marble.</font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><br wp="BR2">        </font> </p>      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> I then applied alkalies,         both carbonated and caustic; these quickened the loosening of the surface         dirt, and changed the tint of the brown stains a little; but they fell         far short of restoring the marble surface to its proper hue and state         of cleanliness. I finally used dilute nitric acid, and even this failed;         for, though I could have gone on until I had dissolved away the upper         marble, and left a pure surface, even these successive applications, made,         of course, with care, but each time producing a sensible and even abundant         effervescence, and each time dissolving enough marble to neutralise the         applied acid, were not sufficient to reach the bottom of the cells and         fissures in which dirt had been deposited, so as to dislodge the whole         of that dirt from its place.</font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><br wp="BR1">        </font> </p>      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> The examination has         made me despair of the possibility of presenting the marbles in the British         Museum in that state of whiteness which they originally possessed, or         in which, as I am informed, like marbles can be seen in Greece and Italy         at the present day. The multitude of people who frequent the galleries,         the dust which they raise, the necessary presence of stoves, or other         means of warming, which by producing currents in the air, carry the dust         and dirt in it to places of rest, namely, the surfaces of the marbles;         and the London atmosphere in which dust, smoke, fumes, are always present,         and often water in such proportions as to deposit a dew upon the cold         marble, or in the dirt upon the marble, are never ceasing sources of injury         to the state and appearance of these beautiful remains. Still, I think         that much improvement would result from a more frequent and very careful         washing; and I think that the application of a little carbonated alkali         (as soda) with the water, would be better than soap, inasmuch as the last         portions of it are more easily removed. It requires much care in washing         to secure this result; but whether soap or soda be employed, none should         be allowed to remain behind.</font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><br wp="BR1">        </font> </p>      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Dry brushing or wiping         is probably employed in some cases; if so, it should be applied with care,         and never whilst the objects are damp, or from the conditions of the weather         likely to be so. In several cases there is the appearance as if such a         process had resulted in causing the adhesion of a darker coat of dirt         than would have been produced without it; for convex, front, underlying         portions of a figure are in a darker state than back parts of the same         figure, though the latter are more favourably disposed for the reception         of falling dirt.</font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><br wp="BR1">        </font> </p>      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Richard Westmacott         Jnr had taken over from his more famous father and namesake (d.1856) as         principal restorer of the Museum's sculpture. He was invited to attend         the meeting at which Faraday's letter was read and concluded that cleaning         the sculpture was a necessary operation as long as it was done 'under         the superintendance of a competent and responsible person in accordance         with the condition of the sculptures and the quality of the marble.'</font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><br wp="BR2">        </font> </p>      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">To the next meeting         of Trustees, Edward Hawkins, Keeper of the Antiquities since 1826 and         now nearly eighty years old, presented his views on how the sculptures         should be cleaned and how the work was to be supervised. (38) The Committee         approved Hawkins' use of 'clay water' for washing marble statues about         to be photographed, but recommended that Westmacott be consulted once         more. (There was rivalry between Hawkins and Westmacott.) The Keeper of         Antiquities had long battled to develop a more independent role for himself         and his Department. The Trustees tended to regard the Keepers as servants         and to disregard opinion from these, their direct employees, preferring         that of outside consultants such as the architects Robert Smirke and his         brother Sydney and the sculptors Richard Westmacott, elder and younger.(39)</font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><br wp="BR1">        </font> </p>      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Westmacott and Hawkins         agreed that the sculptures needed cleaning, but did not agree over the         method. Westmacott favoured Fuller's earth and was given permission to         go ahead by the Trustees (40) The decision did not meet with everybody's         approval. On 18 June 1858 there appeared a letter in <em>The</em> <em>Times</em>         newspaper, signed anonymously by one 'Marmor'. It is the first of three         such letters that remarkably foreshadow the acrimonious exchange surrounding         the 1930s cleaning of the Marbles.</font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><br wp="BR2">        </font> </p>      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> 'Sir - I have seen         with amazement and indignation the Colosseum - that mighty record of imperial         Rome's magnificence - "restored" in part by the descendants of Goths in         Italy, its crevices plastered up and the rich, varied, golden hue, the         result of nearly 2,000 Italian summers, obliterated by a monotonous coating         of filthy colour.

The Elgin Room had been repainted red in 1839 in response         to a rising fashion for strong colour in interior design that had much         to do with the revival of ancient architectural polychromy.(41) Once established,         the colour was to be increasingly used in the nineteenth-century Museum         as a means of striking a contrast between the gallery walls and the sculptures,         which were perceived to be dirty and dingy in appearance.(42) Had the         sculpture been cleaner, then lighter colours might have prevailed. In         fact, therefore, the opposite of Marmor's supposition was the case. It         was the walls that were matched to the sculpture, rather than the other         way round.</font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><br wp="BR2">        </font> </p>      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">These letters are         interesting from a number of viewpoints.

(By contrast John Henning         appears a far more credible character) There is a blanket opposition to         all restoration on principle: interfering with ancient sculpture must         of necessity be bad and a violation of original finish.</font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><br wp="BR2">        </font> </p>      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Trustees met on         26 June 1858 and considered the first two letters (the third appeared         that same day) together with a counter-testimonial by Charles Cockerell,         the architect.

I heartily congratulate you . . .

On 6 January 1859, Hawkins reported that the cleaning         of the greater part of the Graeco-Roman sculptures had been cleaned under         the continuing supervision of Westmacott, but this was far from an end         of the matter.(44) Within ten years the surface of the sculptures had         so deteriorated as to cause Hawkins' successor, Charles Newton, to contemplate         washing them again. He complained of the 'foulness of the atmosphere which         deposits upon them a coat of black, greasy substance, not to be removed         except by washing'. The bad air was attributed to both the London atmosphere         and to 'the necessity of pouring streams of hot air into imperfectly ventilated         rooms.' 'The effect on the sculpture Galleries of these currents of hot         air may be clearly traced on the walls and ceilings which are blackened         according to the set of the currents.'(45) The sculptures were duly washed,         but now Newton recommended that, if the exercise were not to be repeated         every five years, it would be better to protect at least the frieze under         glass. (46) Newton subsequently reported that the glazing of the frieze         was complete and proposed that the pediment sculpture should be similarly         protected.(47) This was never fully carried out, although a trial was         made with the Helios group of the east pediment.

(50) Then in 1932 came the first signs of a change.         Lord Duveen had expressed interest in 'the actual colours of the marble',         so as to know what material to choose for the wall-lining of his new Gallery.(51)         We learn from the diary of the Earl of Crawford, a Trustee, that this         was already a pet concern of his.(52)</font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><br wp="BR1">        </font> </p>      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> 'Duveen lectured         and harangued us, and talked the most hopeless nonsense about cleaning         old works of art. I suppose he has destroyed more old masters by overcleaning         than anybody else in the world, and now he told us that all old marbles         should be thoroughly cleaned - so thoroughly that he would dip them into         acid. Fancy - we listened patiently to these boastful follies . . .'</font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><br wp="BR2">        </font> </p>      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">A metope and a block         of frieze(53) were taken down to the basement and cleaned under the supervision         of Dr H.J. Plenderleith.(54) The stated intention was to establish 'an         effective means of removing the dirt without risk of damaging the marble         or its patina.'(55) The Plenderleith method, we learn elsewhere, was to         apply a neutral solution of medicinal soft-soap and ammonia.(56)</font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><br wp="BR1">        </font> </p>      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The cleaning of the         frieze blocks and metopes according to Plenderleith's method proceeded         through 1932-33. (57) When cleaned, the sculptures were returned to the         gallery, the frieze being replaced in its glass casing. Some of the pediment         sculptures were also cleaned at this time including the 'Iris' (Figure         G) of the east pediment before she was replaced on an experimentally lower         pedestal. At the beginning of 1934, the Keeper John Forsdyke reported         that in the previous year, 'all the slabs of the Frieze on the west side         of the room were taken down to the Basement for cleaning, and replaced.'(58)         The cleaning then fell into abeyance as the masons were deployed on other         duties. On 25 June 1936 Frederick Norman Pryce had become Keeper, and         Forsdyke was elevated to Director of the Museum. Under Pryce the cleaning         was resumed, and in the summer of 1937 fourteen blocks of north frieze         together with west frieze block II mounted on the west side of the room,         were taken down, stripped of all additions in plaster and Portland stone,         cleaned and replaced on exhibition.(59) These had already been cleaned         in 1932, and this was therefore the second attempt at cleaning them. This         phase of cleaning continued through 1937 and the following year when it         was stopped on Monday 26 September.</font></p>    </td>    <td valign="top" height="173" align="center" colspan="2" width="36"><br>    </td>  </tr>  <tr>     <td rowspan="2" align="center" height="139" colspan="2" width="36">       <p>&nbsp;</p>    </td>  </tr>  <tr> </tr>  <tr>     <td colspan="4" height="41"><img src="images/home2.gif" width="709" height="49" usemap="#Map" border="0"><map name="Map"><area shape="rect" coords="61,27,119,41" href="index.html"><area shape="rect" coords="328,25,697,45" href="3.html"></map></td>  </tr></table></body></html>
