It seems to me that what is principally entailed on the Trustees         is to order the preparation of a careful report on each piece of sculpture         which has suffered, so that any student studying these marbles in the         future may be safeguarded against mistakes arising from the condition         of the damaged carvings.

The Director was called         upon to give 'the facts of the case.'</font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><br wp="BR2">        </font> </p>      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> On that same day         the <em>Daily</em> <em>Mail</em> wrote asking for clarification of the         situation. Forsdyke replied that, 'When the Trustees of the British Museum         have such statements to make, they issue them through the Press Agencies,         and you may be sure that no information on this subject will be available         for any newspaper which is not also given to the Daily Mail.</font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><br wp="BR2">        </font> </p>      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> But it seems to me         that there is no more that can be said about these matters. As regards         the sculpture itself, this is on public view, as it has always been, and         any intelligent observer has been able to form his own opinion about its         cleaning for the last six months or more.'</font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><br wp="BR1">        </font> </p>      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The statement that         the sculpture was on 'public view' was only partially true for on 21 March,         <em>The Star</em> remarked upon 'sinister blanks' where some of the pediment         sculpture was missing from the display in the Museum and repeated the         speculation that the 'exquisite patina' of the Marbles had been tampered         with. The 'blanks' can be explained, however, by the process of removing         the sculptures into the new Duveen Gallery.</font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">         </font> </p>      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">On 25 March the <em>Daily</em>         <em>Mail</em> went ahead and published its 'story': 'Elgin Marbles (Worth         £1,000,000) Damaged in Cleaning' in a piece which was well informed and         broadly right: 'Traces of patina have been removed leaving an unnatural         whiteness.'</font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><br wp="BR2">        </font> </p>      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Also on 25 March,         the <em>Daily Express</em> demanded a statement from the Trustees. Forsdyke         had one in readiness. In a letter to him dated 29 March 1939, the Archbishop         approved of the 'very quiet and temperate statement'. Still the Museum         held back from issuing it and Forsdyke sought to play the incident down.         On 1 May an article appeared in <em>The Telegraph </em>claiming that the         Museum was resorting to 'ingenious methods' to conceal from visitors the         true state of the Marbles. Casts had replaced the original pediment sculptures         of 'Iris', Helios and the head of the horse of Selene. The metopes were         nowhere to be seen. The report goes on, 'A rather ungrateful whispering         campaign has been started to suggest that the treatment the Elgin Marbles         have undergone is the responsibility of Lord Duveen'. And then, after         some observations about the Director, comes a very curious touch: 'I understand         that whatever artistic damage may have been done to the sculptures mineralogists         from the Natural History Museum consider that the Marbles, viewed purely         as stone, are unimpaired.'</font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><br wp="BR2">        </font> </p>      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Forsdyke took the         articles that were appearing in <em>The Telegraph</em> to be the result         of a personal animus against him for his having fallen out with a journalist,         'whom I found established here when I succeeded Hill, and whose expulsion         Hill approved.' There had, however, also been a letter addressed to the         Editor of <em>The Telegraph </em>by D.W.S. Hunt, fellow of Magdalen College,         Oxford (11 May 1939). This was the don, later turned diplomat and champion         of champions in BBC TV's <em>Mastermind</em>, Sir David Wathen Stather         Hunt. Forsdyke dismissed his intervention as 'ignorant and foolish' remarking         that if its demands were met the nation would be discredited abroad at         a politically critical moment.(80).<br>        </font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> </font> </p>      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">On 14 May 1939 a long         letter addressed to the Editor by Robert Byron appeared in <em>The Sunday         Times</em> demanding either a statement from the Museum or the asking         of a question in Parliament. Meanwhile, the correspondent had already         made up his mind on the matter:</font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><br wp="BR1">        </font> </p>      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> 'anyone who knows         the patina of Pentelic marble, who has run his hands over the knife-like         edges of the Parthenon or the objects in the Acropolis Museum and felt         those innumerable tiny asperities and translucencies which make that stone         the most vivid material that ever rewarded a carver's skill, can see at         once that the marbles in Lord Duveen's new gallery have lost this patina.         The lustre and the gentleness have vanished.

They found that unauthorised methods         were being introduced in some instances, with the intention evidently         of improving the appearance of the marble by removing spots of discolouration         from its surface. Since this was done without the knowledge of the officers         of the Museum who were responsible for the cleaning, it has not yet been         possible to determine precisely the extent to which these methods were         applied. To anyone but an expert their effect is imperceptible.

Forsdyke justified this understatement with the theory,         which in the event was borne out, that, 'However full the announcement         may be which the Trustees send officially to the Press, it will be amplified         by the representatives of newspapers in London from their own enquiries         and observations. I would therefore advise that the official announcement         be as brief and bare as possible, and that I be authorised to add details         within certain limits in answer to personal enquiries by accredited representatives         of the Press.' There then follows a list of sample questions as follows:         'What were the improper methods? What damage has been done? (This question         to be referred to the enquirers' own powers of observation); Who wanted         to improve the colour? Who made the unauthorised efforts? Why were the         efforts made?

No one denies that some of the marbles have been         pretty drastically cleaned, in certain cases by methods of which no expert         could possibly approve. Nor is it denied that this method of cleaning         had been going on unsuspected at intervals during the last fifteen months.         The authorities discovered what had been happening, were very properly         scandalised, and ordered a return to the harmless soap-and-water method.         Folk who like to think that they have scented out a first-rate scandal         have not been slow to move and a good deal has been said about it, including         the suggestion that the Marbles have been "ruined." The same kind of thing         invariably happens when any dear Old Master (Velasquez's "Silver Philip"         was a case in point) has its face washed.</font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><br wp="BR2">        </font> </p>      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> But what, in fact,         has happened? The sculptures are about to be housed in the new Duveen         Gallery in the British Museum, and, doubtless, the cleaners were anxious         that they should look spick and span before moving in. For over twenty         centuries before Lord Elgin brought them to London, they have stood up         to the weather on the Acropolis. On their way to England they spent some         weeks at the bottom of the sea. None of them were unscathed. Few if any         portions of them have rertained their original surface. Some of them are         wrecks of their former selves. What has now been done to them is negligible         by comparison with what is happening to the portions still on the Parthenon.         Casts of these latter taken in 1802 and again in 1872 reveal the lamentable         results of open-air weathering.</font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><br wp="BR2">        </font> </p>      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> The removal of a         layer of London soot from the British Museum sculptures - especially from         the metopes - has certainly altered their colour; uniformity of colour         they never had. Indeed, slight variation of colour is a characteristic         of weathered Pentelic marble. But the fact that the Museum authorities         themselves are not quite certain which of them have been subjected to         the unconventional methods of cleaning and which have not (some of them         certainly have not) is proof that the aesthetic damage is unimportant.         Subtleties of modelling, like the veins on the horses' bellies and the         sharp chiselling of their manes are still unimpaired. Only a microscopic         comparison between the Marbles in their present state and a set of full-sized         photographic enlargemets of their old surfaces could reveal the damage.         That is a question for the expert. I doubt if the average vistor or even         the average art-lover would notice any change beyond that of colour. But         then, how many average visitors ever gave them more than a passing glance?         If the controversy does nothing else it will teach us to look at them         a little more closely in future.'</font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><br wp="BR1">        <br wp="BR1">        <br wp="BR2">        </font> </p>      </td>    <td valign="top" height="173" align="center" colspan="2" width="36"><br>    </td>  </tr>  <tr>     <td rowspan="2" align="center" height="139" colspan="2" width="36">       <p>&nbsp;</p>    </td>  </tr>  <tr> </tr>  <tr>     <td colspan="4" height="41"><img src="images/home4.gif" width="709" height="49" usemap="#Map" border="0"><map name="Map"><area shape="rect" coords="66,23,127,42" href="index.html"><area shape="rect" coords="535,25,698,42" href="5.html"></map></td>  </tr></table></body></html>
