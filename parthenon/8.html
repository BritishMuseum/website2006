H.         Smith in his monumental book, <em>The</em> <em>Sculptures</em> <em>of</em>         <em>the</em> <em>Parthenon</em> (1910). The other is the photographs by         Fr&eacute;d&eacute;ric Boissonnas and W. A. Mansell for Maxime Collignon's         publication, Le <em>Parth&eacute;non</em> (1912). It is right to be cautious         about the use of such images, but it is also my firm conviction that if         the right questions are asked of them, they can be a valuable and indispensable         resource.(121)</font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><br wp="BR2">        </font> </p>      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><em>Use of Casts</em></font></p>      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">These are most effective         when documenting substantial losses, such as the well known instance of         damage occurring through continued weathering of the west frieze and other         sculptures left on the Parthenon after Lord Elgin's time.(122) Again,         there is the loss of a fragment of drapery from South Metope III mentioned         at the conference by A. Mantis(123) and the flake from the rump of one         of the horses of west frieze block II observed by St Clair.(124) More         problematic is the attempt to use casts as a record of the condition of         previous surfaces. While casts can record a given surface remarkably accurately,         they can also replicate the plastic form of sculpture while at the same         time presenting an altered or entirely new surface.</font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><br wp="BR2">        </font> </p>      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Even in the former         case, where the surface is faithfully reproduced, reading a cast is problematic.         St Clair claims to see evidence of the removal of tool marks in a comparison         of a nineteenth century cast with the original of the shoulders of the         Helios of the east pediment. When the two were brought together in the         Duveen Gallery, however, his claim was shown to be unfounded. The marks         of the claw-chisel indicated on the cast are preserved in the sculpture.(125)</font></p>      <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> </font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><em>Original       Surface</em></font>       <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> There was also discussion         at the conference of the terminology used to describe the surface condition         of the sculptures of the Parthenon, both those in London and in Athens.         One difficulty has to do with the notion of an <em>original surface</em>.         The term was used at the conference with no strict definition of what         this actually meant. As we see them displayed in the Duveen Gallery of         the British Museum, the sculptures are the product of their history in         the Museum and in other previous lives. The variety of surfaces that result         are in a sense all <em>original</em>, but what seems mostly to be meant         by the term is 'the nearest we come to the ancient finished surface as         left by the carver's final touches'.</font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><br wp="BR2">        </font> </p>      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><em>Patina</em></font></p>      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">This term has been         used to mean more than one thing.

For example,         in many parts of the north frieze blocks showing the cavalcade, large         areas of pitting framed within discernible contours are the result of         attack by biological growth on the permanently shaded north side of the         temple.<strong><font color="#CC6600">(<a href="fig1_5.html#fig4">Fig.4</a>)</font></strong>         This natural damage is repeated over much of the north frieze, both in         London and in Athens. It accounts for substantial loss of the original         surface.(128</font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><br wp="BR1">        </font> </p>      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Another sort of weathering         is the visible impact of wind and the rain, ice and dust which the wind         drives against the stone. Parallel lines in the marble represent the contours         of the geological bed of the stone. They are differentially weathered         so that softer elements are stripped out leaving the harder standing proud.         Where this weathering occurs, even the higher surface is always below         that of that which was originally carved. A good example of it is to be         found in the distinctive markings of the head of Selene's horse from the         east pediment.<strong><font color="#CC6600">(<a href="fig1_5.html#fig5">Fig.         5</a>)</font></strong></font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><br wp="BR2">        </font> </p>      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><em>Finishing processes</em></font></p>      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Where neither natural         weathering nor cleaning has removed it, the original surface as defined         above survives.

Interference with the surface of the marble in the 1930s, whatever         we think of its absolute merits was by and large carefully and thoughtfully         done. It was not the aggressive violation that is implied in the documents         of the Board of Enquiry. In particular, Plenderleith's deposition to the         Board suggesting the chipping of the marble and the rubbing of it down         to a depth of one tenth of an inch does not represent the actual situation.         His account was perhaps more an expression of his professional frustration         than a reflection of what actually was done.</font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><br wp="BR1">        </font> </p>      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Nor does the colourful         language of Cesare Brandi, writing in 1950 reflect the true situation.         His talk of a 'ferocious and irreverent scouring' implying an extensive         removal of original surface is unacceptable. Claims that iron tools were         used to scratch the marble and that a point was used to outline the figures         against their background are insupportable. The tools are today preserved         in the Museum's Department of Conservation. There are no iron ones among         them, nor do official documents speak of such.<strong><font color="#CC6600">(<a href="fig6_10.html#fig10">Fig.         10</a>)</font></strong></font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><br wp="BR2">        </font> </p>      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">iii. <u>Types of surface         - a detailed analysis</u></font></p>      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><em>Surfaces unaffected         by the cleaning of the 1930s.</em></font></p>      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Unaffected surfaces,         both weathered and tooled in antiquity, can be found in the great majority         of pediment sculptures and in the east frieze.

In order to understand       what was done here, first let us again identify a weathered surface that       is not affected by rubbing. On the thighs of the Lapith of Metope XXVII       can be seen a clear line demarcating two surfaces.<font color="#CC6600"><strong>(<a href="fig11_15.html#fig12">Fig.       12</a>)</strong></font> On one side is the weathered and unrubbed surface;       this is stratigraphically lower than the smooth surface on the other side.       This smooth surface has coating and, although some of this may have been       removed in the 1930s or earlier, its smoothness is not the result of over       cleaning. It is very close to the surface as left by the ancient carver.       The line, between these two surfaces - preserved and weathered - marks the       edge of the rain-and wind-shadow and is entirely natural. There is very       little, if any rubbing of the weathered surface on this stone. Not even       the background is seriously affected, as in the case of other metopes.<br wp="BR1">      <br wp="BR2">      On SM XXIX by contrast the weathered surface is rubbed, mostly on the background,       but the rubbing is also carried over onto the figure of the girl. The weathering       of the drapery of the girl appears smooth, milky and blunted.<strong><font color="#CC6600">(<a href="fig11_15.html#fig13">Fig.       13</a>)</font></strong> <br wp="BR2">      </font>       <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The rubbing of weathered         surface also occurs in the lower drapery, front and back of figure G of         the east pediment. This is perhaps the best of all examples, for here         a clear boundary can be seen in the difference between the unrubbed drapery         above and the rubbed drapery below.<strong><font color="#CC6600">(<a href="fig11_15.html#fig14">Fig.         14</a>)</font></strong> There was very limited removal of coating here,         since the original surface survived only in the sheltered folds of the         drapery. The difference between rubbed and unrubbed is slight and there         is no discernible drop in level such as is suggested by Plenderleith's         report.</font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><br wp="BR2">        </font> </p>      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">c) Another type of         surface is that of the back of the head of Selene's horse. Old pre-clean         photographs show very little patina, some biological attack and an otherwise         relatively smooth surface. <strong><font color="#CC6600">(<a href="fig11_15.html#fig15">Fig.         15</a>)</font> </strong>This was made smoother by the rubbing of the 1930s.         Suggestions that the front of the head is spoiled by over cleaning are         of course indicative of how little this problem has been understood. The         back is, however, rubbed.<strong><font color="#CC6600">(<a href="fig16_20.html#fig16">Fig.         16</a>)</font></strong></font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><br wp="BR1">        </font> </p>      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">d) A fourth type of         weathered surface is to be found in the Ionic frieze. Partially sheltered         for so long by the coffering of the peristyle, this is less destroyed         than the surface of the more exposed metopes, but nonetheless the original         finish has been weathered away. How is it certain that the original surface         was not scraped off in the 1930s? If it was scraped off then, signs of         the coating would show up in the pre-clean photographs. They do, but only         in isolated areas that are the exceptions proving the rule. Where sculpture,         such as the east frieze, was unaffected by the 1930s cleaning we see a         surface in the photographs that is remarkably similar to that which we         see today. Where the surface <em>was</em> affected, as in the north, south         and west friezes, the sculpture is unnaturally smooth, and the sugary         texture of the marble has a milky finish. The effect is concentrated more         on the backgrounds than on the figures. There is no very great loss of         surface, but where it does occur, there is some blunting of detail. There         is not, however, any loss of detail such as veins in flesh or folds of         drapery.</font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><br wp="BR2">        </font> </p>      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">It may be wrong to         presuppose that such blunting, the creation of an artificial <em>sfumato</em>,         must necessarily all be the result of the 1930s cleaning. One area where         it occurs is the heads of the horses of one of the north frieze chariots,         Block XXIV. It is certain that this was polished in the 1930s, but take         out the dirt that shows in Boissonnas' photograph, and would the image         be very different?<strong><font color="#CC6600">(<a href="fig16_20.html#fig17">Fig.         17</a>)</font></strong></font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><br wp="BR1">        </font> </p>      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">It is also important         to take into account the fact that the polyethelene glycol wax put on         to protect the sculptures after they were last cleaned is contributing         to this <em>sfumato</em> by closing the pores of the marble and making         it appear smoother than it actually is. This protective coat, commonly         known as carbowax, has served the sculptures very well in keeping out         the dirt and preventing the need for another clean since 1970. It may,         however, be suggesting that the smoothing is more than it actually is.<font color="#CC6600"><strong>(<a href="fig16_20.html#fig18">Fig.         18</a> - <a href="fig16_20.html#fig19">Fig. 19</a>)</strong></font></font></p>      <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> </font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">That       said, substantial parts of the frieze, the metopes and much less of the       pediment sculptures did have their weathered areas rubbed smooth by the       1930s cleaning, and this is a change between the way they were before and       how they appear now.</font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><br wp="BR1">      <br wp="BR2">      </font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><em>Coated surfaces       affected by the cleaning of the 1930s. </em></font>      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In the 1930s the coating         was more extensive over the south frieze than ever it was on the north.         There never was, however, on either frieze anything like the survival         of coating that St Clair has claimed was on the sculptures when they came         to the Museum in 1816.(130) The simple proof is the lack of coating on         frieze blocks in Athens. Not only is the north side of the frieze susceptible         to biological attack, but also to erosion by wind. I am assured by my         colleagues in Athens that the run of blocks from the north frieze displayed         in the Acropolis Museum have never had their coatings artificially removed.         The only explanation therefore for the absence of coating on the Acropolis         Museum blocks is that, it was never there when the blocks were found.         Only some joining fragments and Block X of the north frieze have coating.         Block X has a different history from the rest having been removed from         the building to make a window at the time of the conversion of the temple         into a church.(131) Its different surface can be explained therefore by         its different fortune. All other blocks are denuded of their coating,         we must suppose by natural causes. If that is true of the Acropolis sculptures,         then it follows that it must also be true of the British Museum's blocks         from the north frieze. In the Boissonnas photograph, the few traces of         the coating that remain can be readily picked out, notably that around         the calf of the boy on North Frieze XLVII.

The surface today is speckled with coating and         it was not polished. There is, however, extensive polishing of the background         of many blocks of the south frieze, both previously coated and uncoated.         The whole of the background of South Frieze block XIX showing horsemen         is extensively rubbed, both where coating remained and where it did not.<strong><font color="#CC6600">(<a href="fig26_33.html#fig29">Fig.         29</a>)</font></strong></font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><br wp="BR2">        </font> </p>      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The coating is removed         with varying degrees of care.

One fragment of         the Parthenon Frieze in the Acropolis Museum has had its coating removed         and the detail is unnaturally blurred. This is the fragment of Block V         of the East Frieze showing the head of Iris.(133) It used to be shown         in the Acropolis Museum with a cast of the remainder of the block preserved         in the British Museum. It was afterwards separated from the cast and is         now shown as an isolated fragment.(134) It was probably then that the         surface was stripped back to the raw marble.<strong><font color="#CC6600">(<a href="fig26_33.html#fig32">Fig.         32</a>-<a href="fig26_33.html#fig33">Fig. 33</a>)</font></strong><font color="#CC6600">         </font>The Hephaesteum frieze is a more serious case. The removal of coating         from sculptures in a protected, museum environment has a limited effect.         In the case of sculpture exposed to weathering, removal of the coating         appears to speed up the continued erosion of surface. Already by 1974,         when at the behest of J. D&ouml;rig, the east frieze of the Hephaesteum         was cleaned and photographed again, all traces of the colours reported         in the 1950s had disappeared.</font></p>      <p>&nbsp;</p>      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3" color="#000066"><b>Conclusion</b></font></p>      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">I shall sum up by         answering three major questions:</font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><br wp="BR1">        </font> </p>      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">1. How much of the         total area of the sculptures was affected by the cleaning of the 1930s?</font></p>      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">It should now be evident         why the answer to this question is not so straightforward as it might         seem. Since percentages have been published already, an estimate at least         should be given here. Taking together Helios, the backs of the heads of         his horses, part of figure G and the back of the head of the Horse of         Selene we arrive at a figure of some 10% of the total east pediment. Of         the frieze, the east was not touched at all and I am going to exclude         the cavalcade of the north, because it is so little affected and it would         be misleading to include it. The total area then, covering the two blocks         of the west frieze, the chariot sequence of the north frieze and most         of the south amounts to about 40% . The metopes are more affected, but         not all to the same degree and more on the backgrounds than on the figures         and I would estimate their figure at around 60%.</font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><br wp="BR2">        </font> </p>      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">2. Are the sculptures         ruined? </font></p>      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Some people have said         that, with their disfiguring coatings removed, the sculptures look better         than ever.(135) Certainly, to judge from photographs, they look better         now after their 1930s cleaning and the further cleaning of 1969-70, than         they did for much of the nineteenth century and the early decades of the         twentieth. Much of this nineteenth-century dirt still marred the sculptures         in the 1930s. Indeed, even now some blocks of the frieze have a different         colour because they retain carbon from pollution. These are the most weathered         blocks of the north and south friezes that were not affected by the 1930s         clean. There can be no doubt that some part of the outrage expressed at         the 1930s cleaning had to do with the fact that people had become used         to seeing the sculptures in their dirty state.(136)</font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><br wp="BR2">        </font> </p>      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Setting these considerations         on one side, the fact that the cleaning was unauthorised was a scandal;         the way the Museum tried and failed to cover it up, was a scandal, but         - was what actually was done a scandal? One can understand why Duveen,         and perhaps Forsdyke tacitly, wanted to clean the sculpture the way they         did. Their motives were no worse than those that inspired the cleaning         of the Hephaesteum. Alison Frantz wrote innocently of her joy at seeing         the sculptures after cleaning 'to be as fresh as the day they were made.'         In the 1950s, as in the 1930s, the importance of preserving original surface         was not the priority it is today. 'The Greek archaeological authorities',         wrote Thompson, 'inspected the work both during its progress and after;         they expressed themselves as well pleased - thank goodness.'(137) Now,         however, stripped of its historic surfaces, coated in grime and discoloured         by pollution. the frieze has lost its charm.</font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><br wp="BR1">        </font> </p>      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">3. Should they have         done it?</font></p>      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Once again, laying         aside the scandal, the short answer to that question is, no. It cannot,         however, be an absolute judgement. It is an archaeological one. Archaeologists         are greedy for information. We want it all there, with nothing taken away,         no matter how disfiguring. Since, more often than not, we cannot have         it all, we have invariably to resort to reconstructing it. What we do         not want to be told is that evidence was there once, but was taken off         because it didn't look very nice. But this is only one point of view and         since the beginning of archaeology, others have seen it differently. No         shame or scandal should attach to such a view when it is expressed openly.         The scandal of the British Museum's cleaning of the Elgin Marbles 60 years         ago is not what they did, but the way they did it.</font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><br wp="BR1">        </font> </p>      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">St Clair has a different         view. He suggests the historical responsibility of the British Museum         is to preserve the Elgin Marbles in the condition they were in when they         first came to the Museum, and that anything short of that is a failure.         If that were the case, then everybody throughout the world charged with         responsibility for maintaining the material culture of the past, has failed.         All museum curators know that objects in their care change as part of         their museum life. Some museums have better archives than others, and         the British Museum's history is better documented than most. In<em> Archaeologists         and Aesthetes</em> I charted the history of the sculpture collections         of the British Museum and wrote extensively of the many changes that the         sculptures of the Parthenon underwent, including those occasioned by the         foulness of the London atmosphere. No reviewer attached scandal to that         account. No one attempted to condemn the present by the mistakes of the         past. Events in the past, over which the present can have no control,         were seen properly as what they are, history.</font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><br wp="BR2">        </font> </p>      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The controversial         cleaning of the Elgin Marbles happened 60 years ago. All those involved         are dead. The British Museum does not defend their mistakes, nor claim         a right to a record of impeccable curatorship. No museum could. The British         Museum is not infallible; its history is pretty much a formula for the         human condition itself, a series of good intentions marred by the occasional         mistake. The 1930s cleaning was such a mistake. That event colours, but         does not change, the overall responsibility of the Museum's commitment         to safeguarding the Marbles. The historical justification of the Museum's         claim to safeguard them has not been the 'cynical sham' of infallibility         that Clair attributes to it,(138) but the simple fact that if the sculptures         had not come to the Museum when they did, they would not survive as they         do. This is not an opinion. - it is a fact. In an ideal world Elgin's         men would not have damaged the Parthenon in removing the sculptures, but         in an ideal world the Athenians of the fifth century AD would not have         attacked the metopes with chisels; Morosini in the 17th century would         not have aimed his cannons at the temple, and in this century Nicholas         Balanos would never have been put in charge of its restoration, nor would         modern pollution have destroyed its surface.</font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><br wp="BR2">        </font> </p>      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The cleaning of the         Elgin Marbles in the 1930s was an unfortunate incident of another generation         and another age. The tragedy of the present generation has been to witness         the progressive deterioration of the sculptures that have been left until         recently on buildings in Athens, while some are still exposed. The continued         deterioration of the west frieze still on the building until 1993, and         the spoiling of all the Acropolis sculptures exposed to acid rain until         the recent removal of some, but not all, to the shelter of the Acropolis         Museum, is the tragedy of our time.</font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><br wp="BR2">        </font> </p>      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Writing in The Times         newspaper,(139) the editor Peter Stothard called for an end to the 'Chisellers'         War'.
