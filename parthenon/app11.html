Routine         washing with soap and water was authorised in preparation for the removal         of the sculptures to the new Duveen Room, but in the process it appears         that other means of cleaning were employed without the knowledge of the         Museum authorities. Gossip speaks of the patina of some of the pieces         being destroyed; even of the surface being removed to an appreciable extent.         Confirmation is afforded of some irregularity having taken place by the         resignation of an official; but, so far from any material damage having         been done, even an expert eye would find it difficult to distinguish between         the sculptures cleaned by authorised means and those by unauthorised.         The pediment groups do not seem to be involved. From the layman's point         of view the pieces cleaned actually look all the better. But it is the         infringement of archaeological canons that makes the incident serious:         the fact that, without the knowledge of the authorities, means of cleaning         other than those prescribed by them should have been employed, and thus,         not the marbles themselves, but the documentary record of their handling,         have been technically damaged.</font></p>      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">DAILY TELEGRAPH</font></p>      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">MAY 1<sup>ST</sup>         1939</font></p>      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><br wp="BR1">        <br wp="BR2">        </font> </p>      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Elgin Plaster Casts</font></p>      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><br wp="BR1">        <br wp="BR2">        </font> </p>      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Ingenious methods         are employed by the British Museum authorities to conceal from visitors         the state of the Elgin Marbles after their recent "cleaning."</font></p>      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><br wp="BR1">        <br wp="BR2">        </font> </p>      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">I visited the Museum         during the week-end and found that the figure of Iris in the East Pediment         and the horses of the Sun and Moon at either end of this had been replaced         by life-like casts.

Yet still the         Museum has not been able to issue a statement. Is it to be assumed, or         do the Museum authorities assume, that the public has no interest in what         happens to the national art treasures? We have waited in patience.. I         suggest that the time has now come when either a statement must be forthcoming         or the question raised in Parliament.</font></p>      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><br wp="BR1">        <br wp="BR2">        </font> </p>      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Elgin Marbles         have a more universal importance than any other works of art in the keeping         of this country.

But now you are here, it happens that we do possess in London a         set of sculptures from the Parthenon at Athens which will show you the         spirit of the West in its early freshness. From these you may discover         in visible form that conception of human dignity, that power of observation         and that habit of measured statement which makes us prize liberty, pursue         knowledge and exercise reason; for this is the way of thinking - so different         from your own more antique and laborious accumulation of common sense         and aesthetic emotion - which has given us power and wealth and which         the Greeks laid down for us. The Piccadilly tube will take you to the         British Museum.

But at length a champion has emerged, as munificent         as Elgin himself, in the person of Lord Duveen. He has built a gallery         of unequalled magnificence, Doric in idea and so big that the figures         can be seen from the distance the sculptor intended. `To be worthy of         such an edifice it was decided that the marbles must be cleaned. Many         of them have already been installed in their new state, and though the         gallery is not yet open to the public the courtesy of the Museum officials         has enabled certain visitors to examine them there.</font></p>      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><br wp="BR1">        <br wp="BR2">        </font> </p>      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">It is not necessary         to be an authority on Greek sculpture to see that the cleaning process,         however much it may have improved on the previous state of the marbles,         has not restored them to their original appearance. Anyone who knows the         patina of Pentelic marble, who has run his hands over the knife-like edges         of the Parthenon or the objects in the Acropolis Museum and felt those         innumerable tiny asperities and translucencies which make that stone the         most vivid material that ever rewarded a carver's skill, can see at once         that the marbles in Lord Duveen's new gallery have lost this patina. The         lustre and the gentleness have vanished. The lumps of stone remain, robbed         of life, dead as casts.</font></p>      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><br wp="BR1">        <br wp="BR2">        </font> </p>      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Right to Information</font></p>      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><br wp="BR1">        <br wp="BR2">        </font> </p>      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Museum authorities         may argue, possibly with absolute truth, that the armour of grime with         which the marble was coated had already devoured the patina beyond hope         of recovery.

So far this claim has been met by two         rather doubtful arguments; first, that Lord Elgin saved the marbles from         destruction by removing them; secondly, that if they were returned, they         would not be properly shown or cared for. If the marbles can now be shown,         as I think they can, to have been irrevocably damaged by their sojourn         here, the first argument collapses. If that damage was due to negligence,         the second collapses also. It is unlikely that Greece is any more anxious         to pick a quarrel with us at this moment than we are with her. But mysteries         rankle.

The statement         published this morning from the Trustees of the British Museum (even though         it is phrased with an extreme official caution) should finally dispel         the foolish stories that have been told of damage done during cleaning.         In fact, so far as the lay eye can detect, no harm of any kind has been         done to the Marbles; and whether any change (other than the removal of         dirt) will be detected in them by the experts after close and prolonged         examination not even the experts can yet say.</font></p>      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><br wp="BR1">        <br wp="BR2">        </font> </p>      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The relevant points         of the story are soon told. LORD DUVEEN has built a gallery (not yet open         to the public) specially to house the Elgin Marbles, and the opportunity         was taken to clean them. When the cleaning had gone a certain way it was         discovered that, unknown to the officials in charge of the Department         of Greek and Roman Antiquities, a method of cleaning was being used of         which the Trustees disapproved because it was held to be dangerous. The         object of this unauthorized method was, it seems, to remove certain spots         of discoloration on the statues, but whether any such spots were in fact         removed is not known. Certainly no one can tell by ordinary methods of         inspection which of the statues were so cleaned, and which (and these         are the bulk of the series) were cleaned by the accepted methods. The         Elgin marbles show many differences of colour, many varying degrees of         preservation of the surface which ill-informed or malicious criticism         might misinterpret. These differences have nothing to do with the recent         cleaning or with any other, but are due to the varying disposition of         the Marbles on the outside of the Temple of which, facing the sea winds,         they formed part for more than 2,000 years, or to the different positions         in which some of them lay on the ground between their fall from the Parthenon         and their removal by LORD ELGIN. To base upon the recent incident any         argument that the Elgin Marbles are not properly cared for in their present         home is to exaggerate it out of all proportion.

My         protest went unheeded and I was jeered at for concerning myself with what         I was told was no business of mine. Eighteen years have passed, and now         the cleaning and restoration of the Elgin marbles are causing uneasiness,         and questions are asked as to whether the famous marbles have been damaged         in the process. The British Museum authorities have admitted that any         change in the marbles is only to be distinguished by the practised eye         "of an expert," wherever that resides! An interview published in the Press         with the head cleaner of the marbles has elicited the information that         a copper tool "softer than marble" (how incredible) was used. Why a cleaner         and six hefty men should be allowed for 15 months to tamper with the Elgin         marbles as revealed by the head cleaner passes the comprehension of a         sculptor.

But the plaster cast which, for safety's         sake, filled her place during the War was of a nice yellow colour.
