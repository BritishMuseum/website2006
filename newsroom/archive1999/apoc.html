      <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Verdana, Helvetica, sans-serif">The close 
        of the second millennium is an appropriate moment to evaluate the legacy 
        of one of the most vivid and controversial writings in the Christian canon, 
        the Book of Revelation. Its description of an apocalypse that was both 
        destructive and redemptive provided a universal metaphor for the expression 
        of all future eschatology both collective and personal, a rich vein of 
        imagery that remains a force in contemporary culture.</font></p>
      <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Verdana, Helvetica, sans-serif">This exhibition, 
        together with the associated publication, examines the pictorial tradition 
        it engendered as represented principally by illuminated manuscripts, books, 
        single sheet prints and drawings from the 11th century up to the end of 
        the Second World War. Attention is focussed on particular episodes or 
        apocalyptic phases which have often, though not invariably, occurred at 
        the end of centuries and have always been rooted in historical and political 
        circumstances. Most of the material is drawn from the collections of the 
        Museum's Department of Prints and Drawings and the British Library, supplemented 
        by loans from other collections within the United Kingdom, continental 
        Europe and East Coast American collections. Also included is the &quot;Atomic 
        Apocalypse&quot; from the Mexican Day of the Dead. </font></p>
      <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Verdana, Helvetica, sans-serif">After the 
        great medieval manuscript cycles, the defining moment in the development 
        of the pictorial tradition was DŸrer's publication of his Apocalypse woodcuts, 
        which first appeared in 1498; their resonance has been felt at all levels 
        of subsequent portrayal, including examples such as the 1921 film The 
        Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse, in which Rudolph Valentino holds the 
        Revelation of St John adorned with copies of DŸrer's prints. Apocalyptic 
        imagery was quickly appropriated as a vehicle for propaganda and satire, 
        becoming secularised at the hands of artists such as James Gillray in 
        the late 18th century. Gillray's contemporary, William Blake, evolved 
        through his illuminated prophetic books of 1790-1820 and a series of watercolours 
        c.1805-10, a concept of Apocalypse and Judgement that was part of a personal 
        mythology responding to the millenarian currents and revolutionary upheavals 
        of the period in question. </font></p>
      <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Verdana, Helvetica, sans-serif">The growing 
        secularisation of modern society has in no way diminished the power of 
        apocalyptic metaphor which has become embedded in popular culture. Throughout 
        the 20th century it has continued as a vehicle for visions of both destruction 
        and regeneration, of nihilistic despair and futuristic fantasy, in the 
        hands of many writers, artists and film directors, for the cinema has 
        been a critical factor in the transmission of such imagery. As the course 
        of the First World War and its aftermath unfolded exultance turned to 
        despair; the hope of regeneration was replaced by a sense of ultimate 
        destruction on a cosmic scale which continued to gather momentum under 
        pressure of political developments in the 1930s, achieving a terrible 
        realisation in the Second World War. </font></p>
