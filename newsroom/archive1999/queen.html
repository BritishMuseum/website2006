      <p><font face="Arial, Verdana, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Egyptian 
        Queen to Return to Egypt</b></font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Verdana, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The sculpted 
        head of an Egyptian queen, dating to the 13th century BC, is to be returned 
        to the Egyptian Government, thanks to investigative work by British Museum 
        experts. The sculpture (the so-called Head of Meryet), which was smuggled 
        out of Egypt in the early 1990s, is thought to be a representation of 
        Nefertari, principal queen of Rameses II. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Verdana, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Egyptian 
        authorities had for several years sought the sculpture's return from the 
        current owner through the courts, but their case was challenged with the 
        claim that the head is a fake and not a genuine antiquity. The British 
        Museum provided crucial evidence which proved that the sculpture is in 
        fact original. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Verdana, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">At the request 
        of the Egyptian Government, the sculpture was examined in detail (as described 
        overleaf) by specialists in the Museum's Department of Egyptian Antiquities 
        who concluded that, on stylistic grounds, the queen's elaborate and exquisitely 
        carved wig was ancient. A piece of metal on top of the head was the remains 
        of a fixing for a feather headdress in bronze or gold. The face, however, 
        had been altered in more recent times and the inscription on the back 
        of the sculpture was a modern addition.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Verdana, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> The queen's 
        head was next viewed microscopically and under ultra-violet light by the 
        Museum's Stone Conservation Section. Under magnification the surface lines 
        of the face and neck indicated a patchwork of very small pieces of stone 
        set in adhesive, acting as the filling between larger pieces of worked 
        stone. Under the UV light the lines fluoresced, confirming the suspicion 
        that the face was not original. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Verdana, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The queen's 
        face had in fact been made up from a core of marble drilled out of the 
        head and ground down to create material from which to remodel the features. 
        The new face was attached to its ancient surrounds and then worked to 
        give it a weathered and damaged appearance. It is likely that the original 
        face remains masked by the queen's modern features.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Verdana, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Dr Robert 
        Anderson, Director of the British Museum, said, &quot;We are delighted 
        to have played a part in the return of this sculpture to Egypt. We have 
        excellent relations with the Egyptian Government and continue to enjoy 
        collaboration through excavation, conservation, training and the sharing 
        of knowledge.&quot;</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Verdana, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> HE Mr Adel 
        El-Gazzar, the Ambassador of Egypt, said, &quot;The handover of the Head 
        of Meryet is a manifestation of the mutual cooperation between our two 
        governments and their fight against the illegal and sinister trade of 
        cultural artifacts.&quot;</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Verdana, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Visual 
        Examination </b> </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Verdana, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The head, 
        with a small part of the shoulders and chest, has been broken from a slightly 
        less than life size statue. The stone appears to be a grey and white marble 
        with a visible crystal structure which is especially noticeable on the 
        polished surface of the face and neck. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Verdana, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">On the face 
        and neck there is a network of lines which resemble natural cracks or 
        joints in the stone creating a patchwork effect. The lines across both 
        eyes are greenish brown as are those stretching from under the damaged 
        nose to the chin. The lines on the cheeks and neck are light grey. Similar 
        lines are not visible on other parts of the object. On the weathered break 
        surface of the base there is a circular cut line, diameter 85mm, which 
        seems to indicate a core drilling. However, the exposed surface of the 
        stone inside this cut line seems to match that of the remainder of the 
        base.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Verdana, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> The hair, 
        headdress, necklace and rear inscription panel do not display any significant 
        features which might be indicative of restoration. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Verdana, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Under 
        Magnification </b> </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Verdana, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The lines 
        on the face and neck are clearly made up of very small pieces of stone 
        set in an adhesive and are the filling between larger pieces of worked 
        stone. The adhesive setting is especially noticeable in the greenish brown 
        lines. In the polished stone at both sides of the neck there are a number 
        of unnaturally straight 'flaw' lines which meet at unexpected angles. 
        These are the result of pieces of worked stone being set in the neck close 
        to the junction with the hair and necklace. Similar lines can be seen 
        at the sides of the face. Adhesive is visible around the cut line on the 
        base. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Verdana, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Under 
        Ultraviolet Light </b></font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Verdana, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The network 
        of lines on the face fluoresce indicating a material which contrasts with 
        the surrounding stone. This is likely to be the adhesive setting. The 
        face and neck appear as a patchwork of sections of stone. There is scattered 
        minor fluorescence visible on other parts of the object. The adhesive 
        in the cut line on the base also fluoresces. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Verdana, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Conclusion</b></font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Verdana, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The face 
        and neck of this head have been restored using pieces of stone adhered 
        to an ancient surface. The restoration has been set in to the surrounding 
        ancient stone head. The ancient surface may survive under the restoration. 
        The added stone has been worked to produce the current appearance. The 
        origin of the stone used in the restoration is uncertain, but it may be 
        from a core extracted from the base.</font></p>
