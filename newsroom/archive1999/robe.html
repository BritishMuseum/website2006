        Native American War Record Robe at the British Museum</b><br>
        </font>on long term loan to The British Museum</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> This magnificent, 
        pre-Reservation war record robe, made and worn by a Northern Plains leader, 
        c.1825 - 1850, will shortly go on display at the British Museum. Although 
        without any early provenance the story of the painted robe's survival 
        is beguiling. In 1959 a young girl and her mother attended a Scottish 
        sale, at Portalloch House. Hanging in the old kitchen was this extrordinary 
        garment: the girl, aged 16, asked her mother to bid for and buy the robe. 
        Forty years later in London, the now-grown owner took the robe from under 
        her bed, photographed it and sent the images to the museum to establish 
        whether or not the robe was significant. In September 2000, the owner 
        most generously placed the robe on anonymous long-term loan to the British 
        Museum. It is scheduled to go on display in the Museum's Chase Manhattan 
        Gallery of North America during the summer of 2001. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Painted war records 
        represent activities of warriors such as counting coup (capturing trophies), 
        horse raiding, fighting and taking scalps. As worn items robes ensured 
        public recognition for the deeds of the wearer: they would have been worn 
        horizontally so that the stories could be seen. This example is a summer 
        robe, probably from a buffalo cow, with fringed edges and designs painted 
        on the inside. The paint was applied with ‘brushes' or sticks made from 
        the porous interior of elk antlers. The robe is very densely painted: 
        the scenes in the centre are particularly closely placed and in total 
        there may be twenty exploits recorded in great detail. Most of the scenes 
        seem to depict climactic moments when the warrior is outfacing and outfighting 
        his enemy. At the bottom right, for instance, he is shown mounted, facing 
        muskets and holding a lance. His movement forward into the line of fire 
        is represented with four hoofprints. Much of the fine reading of the robe 
        will depend on the understanding of line, colour, the massing of scenes 
        and spacial placement of figures.</font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><br wp="BR1">
