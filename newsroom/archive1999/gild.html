      <p><font face="Arial, Verdana, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">This exciting 
        special loan exhibition, which marks the State Visit in October of President 
        Jiang Zemin on the occasion of the 50th anniversary of the founding of 
        the People's Republic of China, includes treasures never before displayed 
        outside China, many being spectacular discoveries of the last three decades. 
        Its main theme, Tang Dynasty (AD 618 - 906) gold and silver, is a sequel 
        to the British Museum's hugely popular &quot;Mysteries of Ancient China&quot; 
        exhibition held in 1996, which ended with the Han Dynasty (206 BC - AD 
        220). The Silk Routes were important conduits of trade and ideas during 
        both the Han and Tang dynasties, and helped imbue these periods with an 
        exoticism and a cosmopolitanism which was reflected in the sophisticated 
        lifestyle of the capital of Chang'an (present-day Xi'an) in Shaanxi province. 
        </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Verdana, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">As an introduction 
        to the exhibition's main theme, gold, silver and gilded objects from periods 
        prior to the Tang Dynasty include items mostly buried in tombs; gold sword 
        and horse fittings, a replica of one of the bronze carriages and horses 
        from the tomb of China's famous First Emperor, Qin Shi Huangdi (221 - 
        206 BC) and a particularly fine gilt bronze horse from a Han Dynasty tomb. 
        Some ceramics and jades buried during this period are also shown to set 
        the gold and silver objects into a general historical context. The second 
        section of the exhibition focusses on objects hidden in hoards, particularly 
        that from Hejiacun, where a number of beautiful gold and silver artefacts 
        and jewellery were found in 1970, having been hurriedly buried, probably 
        during a political crisis in the mid- 8th century. A number of ceramic 
        figures excavated in the Chang'an area illustrate the fashions, ways of 
        life and pastimes of the Tang aristocracy, while Buddhist statuary emphasises 
        the important role of Buddhism during the Tang Dynasty.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Verdana, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In the final 
        section, the exhibition shows objects offered to Buddhist temples by devotees 
        and secreted in temple crypts, especially those of Qingshan and Famen 
        temples in Shaanxi province, dramatic discoveries made only in the late 
        1980s. These are amongst the most precious Buddhist treasures belonging 
        to China and the Museum is greatly privileged to be able to display them. 
        They include a gold and silver Bodhisattva figure and a set of caskets, 
        in the innermost one of which was hidden the true relic of the Buddha's 
        finger bone. Some utensils for the Tea Ceremony demonstrate the prominent 
        part it played in Buddhist and secular life of the time. </font></p>
