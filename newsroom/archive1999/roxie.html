      <p><font face="Arial, Verdana, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>The Roxie 
        Walker Galleries of Egyptian Funerary Archaeology </b> </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Verdana, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The new Roxie 
        Walker Galleries of Egyptian Funerary Archeology, made possible through 
        the generous sponsorship of the Bioanthropology Foundation Ltd, and the 
        support of the British Museum Society, present the British Museum's unparalleled 
        collection of mummies, coffins, funerary statuettes, amulets and Books 
        of the Dead in a totally new installation. Reflecting the current state 
        of research on this perennially fascinating subject, the new displays 
        combine in depth exploration of beliefs and mortuary practices with an 
        impressive series of integral burial groups spanning Egyptian history 
        from the age of the pyramids to the Roman occupation. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Verdana, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Museum's 
        Egyptian collections are unequalled in the world for their range and quality, 
        comprising objects of all periods from virtually every site of importance 
        in Egypt and the Sudan. A high proportion of this collection of more than 
        80,000 objects comes from tombs or contexts associated with the cult of 
        the dead, and it is these pieces - in particular the mummies that remain 
        among the most eagerly-sought exhibits by visitors to the Museum. At the 
        root of the appeal of the mummies perhaps lies the fascination of an ancient 
        people with whose hopes and fears we can still identify in spite of many 
        cultural differences - a people who have, in a very tangible sense, triumphed 
        over decay and oblivion. The displays in the new galleries aim to trace 
        the evolution of the Egyptians' attitudes to life and death and their 
        expression in the preparations they made for burial. Themes include the 
        preservation of the body, the provision of sustenance for the dead, protection 
        and magical aid through the tomb, amulets, texts and the performance of 
        ritual. A wide range of material includes animal mummies, canopic jars, 
        funerary statues and shabtis, wonderful gilded coffins, amulets, papyri 
        and tomb fittings, some of which have never before been seen by the public. 
        Among the most visually impressive exhibits are the virtually complete 
        burial groups of the physician Gua, of the Twelfth Dynasty (c.1850 BC), 
        and the lady Henutmehyt of the Ramesside period (c.1250 BC), both of which 
        are shown in context for the first time. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Verdana, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The recent 
        rapid development of sophisticated imaging techniques and analytical studies 
        has greatly increased the significance of Egyptian mummies as a potential 
        source of data on the physique, life expectancy, diet, health and illnesses 
        of the ancient population. With the collaboration of several London hospitals 
        the Museum has been able to have mummies imaged using a CAT-scanner (Computer 
        Aided Tomography), a technique that has yielded hundreds of highly informative 
        lateral images of 'slices' through the body, holding the potential for 
        the creation of 3D reconstructions of what lies within the wrappings. 
        This new information is integrated throughout the new displays. The visitor 
        can also contrast the highly sophisticated techniques and findings of 
        modern science with the treatment of mummies in the 18th and 19th centuries, 
        when they were often only viewed as curiosities.</font></p>
