      <p><font face="Arial, Verdana, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>British 
        Museum Acquires Remarkable Roman Drinking Cup</b></font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Verdana, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Museum 
        is delighted to have acquired a unique silver Roman drinking cup, notable 
        both for its exceptional quality and for the scenes of homosexual lovemaking 
        with which it is decorated in relief. Although heterosexual erotic scenes 
        are relatively common in Greek and Roman art, few homosexual scenes have 
        survived. The cup was probably made in the reign of the emperor Nero (AD 
        54-68), when Greek culture enjoyed increased importance in the Roman world. 
        It originally had a pair of vertical handles rising above the rim. Some 
        of the finely engraved or chased details of the scenes were probably once 
        gilded. The foot is of solid silver. A separate plain inner liner facilitated 
        drinking and cleaning. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Verdana, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">There are 
        two scenes on the decoration of the cup, each set indoors with two males 
        sharing a mattress. Their ages and status are carefully delineated, suggesting 
        that the young people were members of elite families of the Greek-speaking 
        eastern provinces of the Roman Empire. The musical instruments shown on 
        the cup (a lyre and double pipes) and the wreaths worn by the youths suggest 
        that they had received an education derived from classical Greek principles. 
        </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Verdana, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">One story 
        about the origins of this exceptional work of art has it that the cup 
        was found in Palestine with coins of the emperor Claudius (AD 41-54). 
        About one hundred years ago the cup was acquired by the American collector 
        and patron of art Edward Perry Warren, then resident in Sussex. More recently 
        it has been loaned by a private owner for public exhibition in the Antikenmuseum, 
        Basel and the Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Verdana, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">It is likely 
        that the cup would have gone abroad had it not been acquired by the British 
        Museum. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Verdana, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The purchase 
        of the Warren Cup for the British Museum has been generously supported 
        by the Heritage Lottery Fund, the National Art Collections Fund and the 
        British Museum Society, together with various anonymous donors and other 
        funds and bequests. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Verdana, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The acquisition 
        of this rare and precious cup, the finest of its kind ever to appear on 
        the market, allows the vessel to be interpreted among contemporary luxury 
        objects in the Museum's extensive collections of Greek and Roman antiquities. 
        The cup will be displayed in the Wolfson Gallery of Roman Antiquities 
        (Room 70). Admission is free. </font></p>
