        More Jewels </b></font>
      <p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> The British Museum 
        has negotiated the long term loan of the More Jewels from the Society 
        of Jesus. The Jewels comprise five items closely associated with Sir Thomas 
        More, which descended in his family until 1755 when they came to the Society 
        of Jesus. Since 1794 they have been at Stonyhurst College in Lancashire. 
        Until now, they have only been seen in temporary exhibitions. Their loan 
        to the British Museum ensures that they will now be on public display 
        and fully accessible for the first time. </font>
      <p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The jewels form a 
        spectacular assemblage of rare survivals. They include a silver seal-die 
        of Sir Thomas More as Sub Treasurer of England (1521-5) which documents 
        More as a royal official. There are also two reliquaries: a gold cross 
        with the inscription "This is a relic of Thomas the Apostle", and a fine 
        gold enamelled pendant which was probably made around 1550 to commemorate 
        his martyrdom. This pendant was mentioned in More family will of 1649, 
        when it was already a family heirloom, and is again recorded in the Notebooks 
        of the antiquary George Vertue in 1728. These beautiful items not only 
        document More as an historical figure, but demonstrate the way in which 
        he was revered and commemorated from the mid-16th century. The More Jewels 
        join the outstanding Tudor collections on permanent display in the British 
        Museum, and are to be seen in Room 46, the Europe, 15th-18th Centuries 
        Gallery.<br>

        Sir Thomas More (1477/8-1535) was one of the outstanding figures of the 
        Tudor age. His role as royal servant, lawyer and scholar of international 
        renown was vital to the expansionist claims of the Tudors under Henry 
        VIII. A lawyer and MP, he entered Henry's service in 1517 as a diplomat. 
        His provocative book <i>Utopia</i>, in which he sets up an ideal society 
        as a critique of his own, was printed in 1516. During the 1520s he was 
        appointed Speaker of the House of Commons, Sub-Treasurer of England, and 
        Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster. He fell from royal favour in his 
        opposition to Henry VIII's divorce from Catherine of Aragon, which led 
        to Henry's denying papal authority and claiming to be Supreme Head of 
        the Church in England. Henry's action split England away from the Catholic 
        community of Europe, which was already divided by the rise of Lutheranism. 
        More was unable to consent to Acts of Parliament which negated papal supremacy 
        and, describing himself as "The King's Good Servant, but God's first", 
        he was executed as a traitor in 1535. Famous for piety and learning in 
        his lifetime, the manner of his life and death ensured him lasting fame. 
        He was canonised in 1935, four hundred years after his execution.</font>
