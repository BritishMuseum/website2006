      <p><font face="Arial, Verdana, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3"><b><font size="2">The 
        Chase Manhatten Gallery Of North America </font></b></font><font face="Arial, Verdana, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><br>
        Opening 26 June 1999 <br>
        Admission free</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Verdana, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The British 
        Museum is home to one of the finest and most important North American 
        collections outside the United States and Canada. From the Great Plains 
        to the Pueblos of the Southwest, from the northern forests to the Arctic 
        shores, they give a vivid insight into the lives and cultures of North 
        America's indigenous peoples both before and after the arrival of Europeans. 
        Now, a generous donation to the Museum by The Chase Manhattan Bank has 
        allowed the creation of this exciting new gallery devoted to the arts 
        and culture of Native North America. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Verdana, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The inaugural 
        exhibition in the new gallery, entitled First Peoples, First Contacts, 
        emphasises the complex cultural diversity of Native North America through 
        the Museum's rich historic collections. Surveying ancient North America, 
        from the earliest Paleoindian hunters 10,000 years ago, the displays then 
        focus on initial European contact and colonisation, through to cultural 
        renewal and the creativity of contemporary Native art. Historic and modern 
        artefacts are juxtaposed to emphasise the vibrancy of ancient traditions 
        and vitality of artists working today. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Verdana, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Native and 
        European contact was part of a prolonged process, extending for centuries 
        and occurring over the vast continent from Newfoundland to California, 
        Florida to Alaska. This complex contested history is illuminated in the 
        new Chase Manhattan Gallery with the earliest Museum collections of unique 
        masks and ceremonial regalia, superb clothing and sculpture. Native individuality 
        is emphasised. Prominent leaders such as the Mohawk Theyanoguin, who visited 
        Queen Anne in 1710, and Hilis Hadjo, the Creek prophet allied to Britain 
        during the War of 1812, are represented by the objects brought to London 
        as gifts. 18th century California is introduced with shell and feather 
        jewellery, and superb basketry used in acorn meal preparation, collected 
        from the Spanish mission at Santa Barbara in 1793. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Verdana, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> From the 
        Pacific Northwest come a great range of carved ceremonial regalia - masks 
        and feast dishes - employed in the celebration of lineage and status by 
        prominent leaders. The Inupiat, Inuit and other Arctic peoples are represented 
        by early examples of the carefully engineered skin clothing required for 
        survival, and by hunting equipment of economical design and sophisticated 
        purpose. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Verdana, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Cree 
        and Dene of the Canadian Subarctic contribute embroidered moccasins and 
        birchbark articles acquired by fur traders, prepared like the fur for 
        the London market by generation after generation of skilled Native women. 
        </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Verdana, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The story 
        of the buffalo hunting peoples of the Plains is told through the Blackfoot, 
        with exhibits of costume and war records. The near extermination of the 
        buffalo and the arrival of agriculture and non-Native farmers, is explained 
        with unique objects associated with leaders such as Red Crow, Louis O'Soup 
        and Poundmaker, who resisted encroachment and turned successfully from 
        hunting to ranching. The peoples of the American West are introduced with 
        hunting equipment and costume collected in the early 19th century by early 
        explorers such as William Clark and Prince Paul of WŸrttemburg, and with 
        superb ceramics, textiles and jewellery from the Southwest - the Navajo, 
        Apache and Puebloan peoples.</font></p>
