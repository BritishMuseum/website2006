        Coins of the Mughal emperors of India</b><br>
        10 May - 9 September 2001<br>
        Gallery 69a<br>

      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Mughal coins are among 
        the splendours of the British Museum collection. This display and 'The 
        Mughals adorned' in the John Addis Islamic gallery coincide with the exhibition 
        of Mughal jewellery from the al-Sabah collection 'Treasury of the World: 
        Jewelled Arts of India in the Age of the Mughals'. Each of these displays 
        offer a different insight into the art and culture of the Mughal period. 
        Coinage is used to examine the origin of the great Mughal leaders, the 
        spread of their empire, and the different currency and dating systems 
        that were used. Also included is an album of Indian miniatures showing 
        scenes from a Mughal mint. The Mughal emperors struck coins of startling 
        beauty and sometimes enormous size, featuring elegant inscriptions in 
        Arabic script, verses of Persian poetry and signs of the Zodiac. Unusually 
        for Islamic coins at this time Mughal coins often depicted portraits of 
        the emperors. The coins on display feature portraits of Emperor Akbar 
        and several of Emperor Jahangir in a variety of poses, undoubtedly struck 
        as presentation pieces. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">These coins were well 
        documented by visitors to the Court and by the emperors themselves. A 
        contemporary historian in his chronicle wrote: 'In the sixth year of the 
        Emperor Jahangir's reign (1611), he gave his orders that a piece of gold 
        weighing one tola (the weight of a gold coin) stamped on one side with 
        the image of Padshah (king), and displaying on the other figure a lion 
        surmounted by a sun should be given to favourite Amirs or most devoted 
        servants, and that they were to wear it respectfully on the sash of the 
        turban or on the breast front as a life preserving amulet'. In 1584 the 
        Emperor Akbar established a new religion (<i>Din Ilahi</i> or Divine Faith) 
        and a corresponding new era, based on solar years and using Persian month 
        names. Solar months are conventionally represented by signs of the Zodiac 
        and Jahangir used these on a series of gold and silver coins that were 
        probably also used for display purposes. In his diary written on the 23rd 
        day of the Ilahi month of Farwardin, regnal year 13 (i.e: 20 March 1618) 
        he says: </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><i>'Previously to 
        this, the rule of the coinage was that on the face of the metal they stamped 
        my name, and on the reverse the name of the place and the year of the 
        reign. At this time it entered my mind that in place of the month they 
        should substitute the figure of the constellation which belonged to that 
        month; for instance, in the month of Farwardin the figure of a ram, and 
        in Ardibihisht the figure of a bull. Similarly, in each month that a coin 
        was struck, the figure of the constellation was to be on one face, as 
        if the sun were emerging from it. This usage is my own, and has never 
        been practised until now'. </i></font></p>
