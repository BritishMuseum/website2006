      <p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Fabled for her sexual 
        allure and cunning intelligence, Cleopatra has fascinated generations 
        of admirers and detractors since her tumultuous life ended in suicide 
        on Octavian's capture of Egypt in 30 BC. A fascinating new exhibition 
        at the British Museum will focus on Cleopatra VII, the last of the Ptolemaic 
        monarchs, tracing her life in Egypt and her liaisons with the two great 
        Roman leaders of the day, Julius Caesar and Mark Antony. The myth and 
        iconic status of Cleopatra, which has grown from antiquity to the present 
        day, will also be examined, through differing cultural attitudes to Cleopatra 
        and her story and through the representation of the queen by artists, 
        playwrights, composers, film makers and writers.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">An introductory section 
        sets the scene for the birth of the future queen in about 70 BC. Sculptures, 
        inscriptions, ceramics and bronzes illustrate the earlier Ptolemies' representation 
        of themselves as both Greek monarchs and Egyptian pharaohs, who exerted 
        control over the Egyptian population by dominance of the highly organised 
        priesthood. Cleopatra, the first of the Macedonian monarchs to learn Egyptian, 
        proved an able manipulator of religious authority. After her death, Octavian 
        ordered the destruction of all her images, but Archibios, a wealthy Alexandrian 
        begged him to spare the statues of Cleopatra erected in Egypt. It is likely 
        that surviving images of Cleopatra in the Egyptian style, many only identified 
        in the course of research for this exhibition, were among the saved statues, 
        to the Romans of little consequence but to the Egyptians sacred images. 
        The exhibition will also include the two surviving sculptured heads generally 
        accepted as representing Cleopatra in the Hellenistic Greek style as she 
        appears on her coins.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">A number of fascinating 
        new discoveries including a basalt head of a ruler, possibly Cleopatra's 
        son by Caesar, Ptolemy XV Caesarion, have been recently lifted from Alexandria 
        harbour, especially for this exhibition. Many more finds from other recent 
        excavations provide a picture of life in the royal capital and reveal 
        the impact of Alexandrian culture on the wealthier inhabitants of the 
        Bay of Naples and upon Rome itself, where Cleopatra held court for nearly 
        two years during Caesar's dictatorship.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">I</font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">t 
        was said that Cleopatra presented herself to Caesar rolled in an Oriental 
        carpet. Her meetings with Antony were also elaborately stage-managed, 
        and the mythologising of Cleopatra clearly began in her own lifetime. 
        She incurred as much hostility as admiration, and after her death a very 
        negative image of 'the foreign queen' was energetically promoted by her 
        victorious Roman detractors. The exhibition traces ancient attitudes to 
        Cleopatra, even including some caricatures of the queen. The myth of Cleopatra 
        is traced through the ages to the present day, as her tragic tale is told 
        through conventional and more diverse forms of media such as ceramics, 
        jewellery and early watches.</font></p>

        edited by curator Susan Walker will be available from 9 April, published 
        by the British Museum Press. The catalogue contains contributions from 
        key international scholars and explores the myth and reality that surrounds 
        antiquity's most famous queen. A beautiful gift book, Cleopatra's Face: 
        Fatal Beauty by Michelle Lovric, will also be available from 9 April.</font></p>
