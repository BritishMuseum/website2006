      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Mount Fuji is renowned 
        worldwide as Japan's highest and most perfectly-shaped mountain. Serving 
        as a potent metaphor in classical love poetry and revered since medieval 
        times by mountain-climbing sects of both the Shint and Buddhist faiths, 
        Fuji has taken on many roles in ancient Japan. This exhibition will explore 
        a wide range of manifestations of the mountain in more recent visual culture, 
        as portrayed in 100 works by Japanese painters and print designers from 
        the 17th century to the present. Featured in the exhibition will be the 
        full set of colour prints by Hokusai from his most famous series Thirty-Six 
        Views of Mount Fuji (c.1830).</font></p>

        Japan</b><br>
        BP Ethnography Showcase <br>
        13 June - 30 September 2001 <br>
        Admission free</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">This showcase will 
        look at how the ephemeral souvenir and its mass consumption are used to 
        highlight and emphasise local and regional identity. The exhibition will 
        examine Japanese tourism, looking at the way that the Japanese travel, 
        the souvenirs they make and sell and the acquisition and exchange of those 
        gifts. Objects such as amulets, plastic foods, post-cards, photographs 
        and other more conventional items will be used to explore the historical 
        background of travel in Japan and the themes of pilgrimage, regional distinctiveness 
        and the visual representation of place. The imagery and cultural references 
        used on souvenirs will also be examined inviting the visitor to think 
        about Japanese cultures whilst reflecting on their own presence in the 
        British Museum. </font></p>

        Japanese Galleries<br>
        5 September - 2 December 2001<br>
        Admission charge</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Following the success 
        of Arts of Buddhism in 1985 and Hinduism in 1992, this important loan 
        exhibition will be devoted to the extraordinary range of art and artefacts 
        associated with the Shinto religion. One of the flagship events of the 
        Japan 2001 festival, the exhibition will show material borrowed by Japan's 
        Agency for Cultural Affairs from over 70 shrines, temples and museum collections, 
        ranging from the ceramics of the mysterious Jomon culture of 10,000 BC 
        to the magnificent sculptures and paintings of the Heian and Kamakura 
        periods. </font></p>

        Aomori Float and Japanese Kites</b><br>
        Wellcome Trust Gallery<br>
        14 November 2001 - March 2002<br>
        Admission free</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Kite flying in Yokaichi 
        and the Nebuta festival in Aomori, as with many other events in Japan, 
        have their roots in rituals associated with fertility and rice agriculture 
        and bring together local communities in the preparation and celebration 
        of a lively event. Messages to the gods are gummed to the back of many 
        kites while festival floats are used as an invitation to the gods to join 
        in the festivities. A variety of Japanese kites will be drawn from the 
        Museum's collections to display on the ceiling of the gallery while a 
        large float from the Nebuta festival will provide a striking illuminated 
        structure. Nebuta are giant lanterns, up to 5m high and 7m wide, which 
        depict dramatic three-dimensional scenes. During the first four weeks 
        of the display a Nebuta will be constructed in the gallery allowing visitors 
        to watch the progress of the work and to interact with the artist and 
        his team.</font></p>
