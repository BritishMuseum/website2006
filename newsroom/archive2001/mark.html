        to Mark Antony: Images of Power on Ancient Coins</b><br>
        11 January - 6 May 2001<br>
        Room 69a<br>

      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">'<i>The crown will 
        find an heir: great Alexande<br>
        Left his to the worthiest; so his successor<br>
        Was like to be the best.'<br>
        The Winter's Tale, Act 5, Scene 1</i></font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The great figures 
        of Greek and Roman history from Alexander the Great to Mark Antony are 
        familiar across the globe. Rarely, however, does the opportunity arise 
        to observe the way they were depicted in their lifetimes. Statues are 
        rare, and paintings have not survived. Very often the only way to see 
        the finest images of these once powerful individuals are on the coins 
        minted during their lifetimes or shortly after their deaths. These depictions 
        are particularly meaningful as they reveal the way in which these leaders 
        wanted to be seen. Thus silver coins of Mark Antony from 30BC show him 
        wreathed with ivy, a reference to the Greek god of wine, Dionysus. Antony 
        liked to be flattered by being hailed the 'new Dionysus'. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Alexander the Great's 
        conquest of the known world ( 336 to 323 BC ) ensured that forever after 
        his image was instantly recognisable and highly influential in the power-games 
        of his successors, the Greek rulers of the Ancient Near East and Egypt. 
        King Lysimachus who controlled Turkey and the Balkans after Alexander's 
        death, used the image of Alexander on a gold stater to emphasise his status 
        as Alexander's legitimate heir. Even Rome's most potent men like Pompey, 
        Julius Caesar, Mark Antony and Augustus sought to emulate Alexander's 
        world-conquering achievements, and modelled their careers and public images 
        on his. A silver denarius minted after Pompey's death in the late 40s 
        BC by his son Sextus reveals that Pompey styled himself 'Pompeius Magnus', 
        Latin for 'the Great' in direct reference to Alexander. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Drawing on the unrivalled 
        collection of the British Museum, now supplemented by the recent C.A Hersh 
        bequest of 8,000 Greek and Roman coins ( an intended gift by American 
        Friends of the British Museum ), this exhibition reveals the fascination 
        of the image of Alexander the Great for the rulers of the ancient world. 
        Gold and silver coins produced with superb skill preserve the wonderfully 
        evocative portraits of leaders who once bestrode the world and whose fame 
        has stood the test of time. </font></p>
