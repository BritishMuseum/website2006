        1550-1620<br>
        </b>27 September 2001 - 6 January 2002<br>
        Prints and Drawings Gallery (Room 90)<br>

      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The extraordinary 
        growth of printmaking in early modern Italy had a huge impact on the history 
        of European art and on the exchange of images and ideas in western culture 
        generally. The period between 1550 and 1620 saw the emergence of large-scale 
        commercial print publishing in Italy for the first time and a prodigious 
        increase in the quantities of prints being produced. From the most exquisitely 
        rendered mythological and devotional images, which were the artistic match 
        for any painted equivalent and as eagerly collected, to maps, allegories, 
        erotica, records of antiquities, and 'low-life' depictions of street brawls 
        and the tradesmen and artisans who crowded Italy's urban centres, the 
        range of subjects and ideas represented in prints of this period was enormous. 
        Sold at fairs and festivals, pasted on tavern walls, collected in albums, 
        displayed outside print shops and framed in people's homes, printed imagery 
        became increasingly visible to every rank of Italian society and central 
        to the way its members pictured the world and their place in it.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">With over 150 examples 
        from the Museum's unrivalled collections and a number of important loans, 
        The Print in Italy will be the first exhibition to present a broad and 
        representative survey of printmaking activity during this period. It will 
        explore how and why Italy became such a dynamic centre for print production 
        through the activities of domestic and international practitioners of 
        the calibre of Giorgio Ghisi, Federico Barocci, Annibale and Agostino 
        Carracci, Cornelis Cort, Aegidius Sadeler and Francesco Villamena. Divided 
        into three main sections, the exhibition begins by examining the actual 
        processes of printmaking, from the way that designs were prepared through 
        the making of the plates to the printing and packaging of prints for sale. 
        In the second section, the theme is the types of people - designers, engravers, 
        printers and print dealers - who undertook the publishing of prints. Finally, 
        the focus is on places: the ways in which the printmaking business operated 
        within particular cities. Rome and Venice were by far the most important, 
        but Bologna and Siena are examined as well.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">There have been two 
        guiding principles behind the selection of works. One has been to represent 
        the range of subjects and the different media - engraving, etching and 
        woodcut. The other has been to make the maximum possible use of contemporary 
        written evidence. Documentary materials such as letters, contracts, payments, 
        records of court cases and biographies can all illuminate the methods 
        and motivations of printmakers and a great deal can often be extracted 
        from what is inscribed on the plates themselves. Using such supporting 
        information, the exhibition will argue that large-scale commercial print 
        publishing encouraged creative diversity rather than conformity and that 
        small-scale production continued to flourish alongside, resulting in an 
        extraordinary variety of high-quality work. Titian, for example, directly 
        employed Cornelis Cort to engrave eight plates after his compositions 
        and by the 1560s printmaking was attracting an unprecedented level of 
        critical interest from writers and collectors. The exhibition will also 
        show that prints that have long been classified as merely 'reproductive' 
        of other artists' designs are better understood as complex and creative 
        graphic interpretations which were often highly prized in their own right.
