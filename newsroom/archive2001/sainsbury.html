      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Sainsbury African 
        Galleries</b><br>
        Great Court Opening<br>
        March 2001<br>
        Admission free </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Sainsbury African 
        Galleries will mark the return to Bloomsbury of the Museum's magnificent 
        African collections after nearly 30 years at their temporary home at the 
        Museum of Mankind in Piccadilly. Occupying a space of approximately 850 
        square metres and divided into five principal areas, the new galleries 
        will be an integral part of the Great Court project and will provide a 
        substantial and permanent exhibition space for one of the finest collections 
        of African art and artefacts in the world. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The great strength 
        of the collections lies in their chronological and geographical breadth. 
        Comprising over 200,000 objects, they encompass both archaeological and 
        contemporary material from northern and sub-Saharan Africa and Madagascar, 
        offering an unparalleled comparative archive of textiles, ceramics, metalwork 
        and wood sculpture, that includes both unique masterpieces of artistry 
        and objects of everyday life. Highlights include the magnificent brass 
        head of a Yoruba ruler from Ife, Nigeria, Afro-Portuguese ivories of the 
        15th and 16th centuries, Asante goldwork from Ghana, the large corpus 
        of Benin brass castings, as well as selected pieces from the Talbot collection 
        of masks and carvings from southern Nigeria, and from the Torday collection 
        of Central African sculpture, textiles and weaponry. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The initial display 
        of over 600 objects will be drawn from across the entire continent. Traditionally 
        under-represented regions such as the Maghrib, Northeast Africa and Madagascar 
        will be featured strongly. There will be a significant number of objects 
        collected recently by Museum staff in the field, highlighting the modern 
        as well as the historical life and art of Africa. In addition to the rich 
        collections from ancient kingdoms such as Benin and Asante, the work of 
        some of Africa's foremost contemporary artists will be displayed, emphasising 
        both their innovative qualities and the dynamism and continuity of many 
        cultural and artistic traditions. Arranged thematically, there will be 
        sections examining wood sculpture, masks and masquerade, pottery, brass-casting, 
        forged metalwork, textiles and items of personal adornment. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The displays will 
        not attempt to present a comprehensive overview of African art and culture. 
        Instead, by focusing on certain aspects of African cultural life, past 
        and present, it is hoped that the diversity and vitality of the continent's 
        artistic achievements will be revealed. Video presentations and slide 
        sequences within the different sections will provide a context for some 
        of the key objects on display and demonstrate contemporary usage. Situated 
        within the Great Court, the Sainsbury African Galleries will mark a significant 
        stage in the gradual return of the Museum's Ethnography collections to 
        Bloomsbury. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">They will be linked 
        to the Mexican and North American galleries on the north side of the Museum 
        and in the future to galleries for Asian, Central American, European and 
        Pacific cultures</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">.January 2001 </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The exhibition will 
        be accompanied by the book <i>Africa: Arts and Cultures</i>, edited by 
        John Mack, London: BMP, 2000. Gallery guides and other teaching materials 
        will be published as part of the African education programme.</font></p>
