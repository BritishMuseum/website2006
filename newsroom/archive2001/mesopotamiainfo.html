        Further Information </font></b></font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Mesopotamia consists 
        of ten chapters, each covering a different aspect of ancient culture. 
        Each topic is presented in three ways. The ‘Story' tells an interactive 
        story relating to the topic; in the ‘Explore' the user can investigate 
        the topic in their own way and at their own pace; the ‘Challenge' section 
        involves an animated activity, designed to test historical skills- and 
        to be fun. The ten chapters are:</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Geography:</b> 
        read about the heroic adventures of Gilgamesh to discover the natural 
        resources and landscape of ancient Mesopotamia, explore a collection of 
        different maps and become an ancient Mesopotamian farmer, struggling to 
        grow your crops for harvest.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Gods, Goddesses, 
        Demons and Monsters:</b> read a Mesopotamian creation story, explore an 
        illustrated encyclopaedia of gods, goddesses, demons and monsters and 
        help the gods collect their belongings and find their way home to their 
        own cities.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Time:</b> read

      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Tombs:</b> experience 
        the highlights of Leonard Woolley's expedition to the Sumerian city of 
        Ur; explore the Royal Tombs he discovered and play one of the oldest board 
        games in the world, found by Woolley in a grave at Ur.</font></p>

        the library of a Babylonian astronomer and then predict the movements 
        of planets. </font></p>

        a merchant to learn about trade and see your story unfold as you help 
        make decisions; find out about methods of transport and try your hand 
        at bartering to see how good you are as a Babylonian merchant. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Palaces:</b> read 
        about King Sennacherib who built an amazing ‘Palace without a Rival',

      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Staff Room area 
        helps teachers get the most out of the site and supports their classroom 
        teaching of Mesopotamia. Resources include background information, discussion 
        topics, printable worksheets and follow-up activities. It also provides 
        paths through the site, which give teachers maximum flexibility according 
        to how much time is available. The Staff Room is designed as an expandable 
        resource, to which we can add resources according to demand.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Responses to the 
        Ancient Civilizations Series</b></font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Ancient Egypt (<a href="http://www.ancientegypt.co.uk" target="_blank">www.ancientegypt.co.uk</a>), 
        the first of the Ancient Civilizations series, was launched in September 
        1999. In its first year it had almost 300,000 visitors and is currently 
        running at over half a million page hits per week. It was short-listed 
        for the BETT 2000 Award for Learning Resources Online and the DCMS Quality, 
        Efficiency and Standards Team (QUEST) have singled it out for its "exciting 
        educational content" as "a highly interactive and well constructed environment 
        for Key Stage 2 learning" (Creating e-Value, August 2000). Press responses 
        included the TES "This site... is likely to become an instant classic", 
        while Form 5NL from Greneway School, Royston, Herts. wrote "We have just 
        visited your Ancient Egypt site: it was very interesting and exciting 
        and well-organised. We liked the challenges, they were excellent. The 
        pyramid story was cool". </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>NTT East's Sponsorship 
        of Ancient Civilizations</b></font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Nippon Telegraph 
        and Telephone East Corporation (NTT East) has supported the British Museum's 
        Educational Multimedia Unit since its creation in 1998. This generous 
        sponsorship has enabled the Museum to design and create Ancient Civilizations 
        as a series of substantial online learning resources. NTT East also translates 
        the websites into Japanese, under the guidance of Japanese scholars, and 
        makes them available to Japanese schools. Ancient Egypt is accessible 
        in Japanese at <a href="http://www.wnn.or.jp/wnn-b/" target="_blank">www.wnn.or.jp/wnn-b/</a>.

      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Onsite ICT learning 
        in the British Museum</b></font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">As part of the Clore 
        Education Centre, inaugurated by the Rt Hon David Blunkett MP on 14 March 
        2001 at the conference The Learning Power of Museums and Galleries, an 
        ICT Seminar Room is being developed to serve as the onsite hub for the 
        Museum's online learning. It will include 15 workstations, equipped with 
        the Museum's online learning resources, including COMPASS, its interactive 
        database of the collections, and will be fully adaptable to serve children, 
        adults and special needs visitors. At the Mesopotamia launch, a class 
        will be using <a href="../current/www.mesopotamia.co.uk" target="_blank">www.mesopotamia.co.uk 
        </a>in the ICT Seminar Room, working with the latest in interactive whiteboard 
        technology. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Mesopotamia at 
        The British Museum</b></font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The British Museum's 
        collection from the Ancient Near East is one of the most comprehensive 
        in the world. For some years the Museum's curators and educators have 
        been working together to ensure it attracts the attention it deserves, 
        both from educational audiences and from the general public, and curators 
        from the Department of the Ancient Near East have been fully involved 
        in creating the Mesopotamia website. Other recent initiatives have included 
        study days for A level students, in association with the British Association 
        for Near Eastern Archaeology, and INSET object-handling sessions on ancient 
        cuneiform for teachers in local London boroughs. The forthcoming exhibition, 
        Agatha Christie and the Orient (9 November 2001 - 17 March 2002) will 
        remind British audiences of an important period in the archaeological 
        re-discovery of the Near East.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>More Information 
        About Events at the Launch</b></font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The British Museum 
        values its partnership with local schools and children from a Camden primary 
        school will be taking part in the Mesopotamia launch. We have also worked 
        with other local schools in trialing the Ancient Civilizations series. 
        </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The epic story-teller, 
        Ben Haggerty, is well-known for his performances of the Epic of Gilgamesh. 
        Gilgamesh may have been an actual king ruling in the city of Uruk, in 
        southern Mesopotamia, around 2700 BC, but legendary stories gradually 
        gathered around him. By 2000 BC there are five surviving Sumerian stories 
        about him; in the second millennium these were reformulated into a great 
        Babylonian epic; the best-known version of which comes from the Assyrian 
        royal library at Nineveh in the seventh century BC. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Royal Game of 
        Ur is a version of the ‘Game of Twenty Squares', one of the most popular 
        board games of the ancient world. The original game board is displayed 
        in Room 56. It was found by Leonard Woolley in the cemetery at Ur, in 
        southern Iraq: the wood had decayed but the inlay of shell, red limestone 
        and lapis lazuli survived in position. It dates from c.2600-2400 BC.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">We do not know the 
        exact rules of the game, but from references in ancient documents, we 
        know that it was a race game for two players. Pieces were allowed on to 
        the board at the beginning only with specific throws of the dice, and 
        we know that rosette spaces were lucky. The gaming pieces for this particular 
        board did not survive, but other gaming pieces made of inlaid shale and 
        shell were excavated at Ur, as were tetrahedral-shaped dice. </font></p>
