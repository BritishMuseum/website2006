      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3"><b>100 Views of Mount 
        Fuji</b></font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><br>
        11 May - 29 July 2001<br>

        Admission free</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Mount Fuji is renowned 
        worldwide as Japan's highest and most perfectly-shaped mountain. Serving 
        as a potent metaphor in classical love poetry and revered since medieval 
        times by mountain-climbing sects of both the Shint and Buddhist faiths, 
        Fuji has taken on many symbolic and cultural roles and continues to exert 
        a powerful influence particularly on Japanese visual culture. The first 
        of four shows that the British Museum is staging as part of the <a href="/newsroom/current/japan.html">Japan 
        2001 festival</a>, this exhibition explores a wide range of manifestations 
        of this most inspirational of mountains as portrayed in 100 works by Japanese 
        painters and print designers from the 17th century to the present. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The exhibition begins 
        with an examination of the more traditional Kan and Tosa schools which 
        served the military and court aristocracy during the Edo period (1600-1868) 
        and goes on to chart the emergence of influential new styles which were 
        beginning to filter into Japan from China and Europe via the trading port 
        of Nagasaki. Some Japanese artists, for example, looked to the Chinese 
        scholar-painting (bunjinga) tradition as an escape from orthodoxy, while 
        others championed Western-style naturalism as a more accurate means to 
        record the landscape. By the end of the Edo period a dozen or more schools 
        of painting were operating in parallel, catering to different classes 
        and cultural groups. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The rapid growth of 
        cities and the unique 'townsman' (chnin) culture of consumption and pleasure-seeking 
        which accompanied it - particularly in Edo (modern Tokyo) - was also to 
        prove highly influential and was mirrored in the paintings and colour 
        woodblock prints of the Ukiyo-e ('Floating World') school. But by the 
        late 18th and 19th centuries urban artists of many schools were heading 
        out from the cities in search of new landscape subjects and Mount Fuji 
        presented a ready symbol both for 'Nature' and for the nascent ideology 
        of Japan as a modern nation-state. The exhibition also examines the way 
        that new currents of empiricism and subjectivity have enabled Japanese 
        artists of recent centuries to project a surprisingly wide range of personal 
        interpretations onto what was once regarded as such an eternal, unchanging 
        symbol.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Drawn entirely from 
        the Museum's rich collections, 100 Views of Mount Fuji will present traditional 
        paintings of the Kan, Sumiyoshi and Shij schools alongside the more individualistic 
        print designs of Utagawa Hiroshige (1797-1858)and Katsushika Hokusai (1760-1849), 
        including the complete set of colour prints and designs from Hokusai's 
        famous series 'Thirty-Six Views of Mt.Fuji' (c.1830). The final section 
        will include modern and contemporary work by artists such as Maekawa Sempan 
        (1888-1960), Munakata Shik (1903-75) and Hagiwara Hideo (b. 1913) that 
        indicate that Mount Fuji still retains a dominant position in the cultural 
        psyche of Japan.</font></p>

        catalogue '100 Views of Mount Fuji' by Timothy Clark accompanies the exhibition
