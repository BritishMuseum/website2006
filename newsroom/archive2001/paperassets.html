      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Paper Assets - 
        Collecting Prints and Drawings 1996-2001</b><br>
        4 May - 16 September 2001<br>
        Prints and Drawings Galleries (Room 90)<br>
        Admission free</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The British Museum's 
        Department of Prints and Drawings houses one of the largest and most representative 
        collections of western graphic art in existence. Freely available to any 
        member of the public to study and enjoy in the department's students' 
        room, they amount to some three million items and range from some of the 
        earliest examples of western art on paper to leading-edge work produced 
        within the past year. New acquisitions are the lifeblood of these superb 
        collections and provide an ongoing source of inspiration to scholars, 
        researchers and students, as well as to contemporary artists, designers 
        and the general public. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Every five years the 
        department 'blooms like a yucca plant' according to one past review, and 
        presents a selection of the work acquired during the intervening period 
        through purchase, gift and bequest. For this new exhibition, around 200 
        items will be on display from more than 3000 which have entered the collection 
        since the beginning of 1996. Covering the period from the end of the 15th 
        century to the present day, they will encompass grand Old Master prints 
        and drawings by European artists such as Lucas Cranach, Hans Baldung and 
        Jacques-Louis David, new additions to the Museum's important collection 
        of German Romantic prints, and a range of modern material including a 
        magnificent study by Picasso for the seminal <i>Les Demoiselles d'Avignon</i> 
        (1906-7). </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The exhibition will 
        also present important work by a broad range of contemporary artists including 
        Georg Baselitz, David Hockney, Antony Gormley, Bill Woodrow, Richard Wilson, 
        Kiki Smith, Langlands and Bell, Jake and Dinos Chapman and Cornelia Parker. 
        One of the featured works by Gormley will be an installation drawing for 
        his famous Gateshead sculpture <i>Angel of the North</i>, while part of 
        the Chapman Brothers' contribution will be a selection from their powerful 
        series of etchings <i>Jake and Dinos' Disasters of War</i> - a project 
        inspired by the graphic masterpieces of Otto Dix and Goya which are some 
        of the most consulted works in the department.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> A separate section 
        of the exhibition will reveal a vigorous tradition of popular and satirical 
        printmaking and draughtsmanship from the 17th century to the present day 
        including a notable body of work by Ronald Searle inspired by, and named 
        after, Hogarth's famous series of engravings <i>The Rake's Progress</i> 
        - another mainstay of the department's print collections. By contrast, 
        selections from the world's definitive collection of cigarette cards, 
        which now belongs to the Museum through the bequest of Edward Wharton-Tigar, 
        will feature a fascinating array of sporting heroes and the stars of stage 
        and screen from the end of the 19th century to the mid-20th century.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Roughly half the acquisitions 
        are the result of bequests and gifts (many from the artists themselves) 
        and - though government funding still underpins purchases - many of the 
        remainder depend on the generosity of donors, in particular the Heritage 
        Lottery Fund, the Arcana Foundation, the National Art Collections Fund, 
        the British Museum Friends and the newly formed Patrons of Old Master 
        Drawings. </font></p>
