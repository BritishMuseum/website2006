      <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b><font color="#000066">The 
        Big Draw at The British Museum</font></b></font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>The First Big Draw 
        at The British Museum, Saturday 29 September, 10.00 - 17.00<br>
        </b>This is a trailblazer for the Big Draw, a UK wide initiative aimed 
        at getting everyone in the country to draw. A programme of events, organised 
        jointly by the Campaign for Drawing and the British Museum, will take 
        place in many of the Museum's galleries and the Great Court. Well known 
        artists, cartoonists, illustrators, architects and scientists such as 
        Quentin Blake, Gerald Scarfe and Posy Simmonds, Will Alsop and Sir Roger 
        Penrose will be among those leading by example. Visitors can try drawing 
        from life, architecture or sculpture, or explore the various aspects of 
        archaeological illustration, printmaking and digitalised imagery. This 
        is an open invitation for all visitors to explore visual expression - 
        regardless of age, ability or previous experience.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> The day's events 
        begin at 10.00 when Quentin Blake's 'dream team' will create a surprising 
        banner, revealing some unusual views of the Great Court and The British 
        Museum. This will be unfurled, with a trumpet fanfare, at 12.30. Easels 
        and drawing materials will be available throughout the Great Court and 
        the Museum's galleries, with an army of volunteers on hand to offer encouragement. 
        Participants can then take their artwork down to the Drawing Lab and turn 
        their sketches into mono-prints and posters. Champion of the Pre-Raphaelites, 
        John Ruskin (played by James Heard), will give a practical lesson based 
        on his famous 'Elements of Drawing'. At a lunchtime lecture at 13.15, 
        Quentin Blake, Peter Brookes and Linda Kitson will explain what drawing 
        means to them. At 16.15 a colloquium of distinguished architects, including 
        Sir Richard MacCormac and Edward Cullinam will draw 'on their imagination'. 
        During the afternoon there will be a visit to the Prints and Drawings 
        Students Room, to view work by famous 'drawers' from the past such as 
        Matisse and Picasso. A complete list of artists involved, and events for 
        the day, is available on request.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>The Big Draw at 
        The British Museum, Saturday 20 October, 10.00 - 17.00</b><em><b><br>
        </b></em>This is the Campaign for Drawing's national focus, when groups 
        and individuals in hundreds of museums, galleries, schools, hospitals 
        and libraries come together to draw. The British Museum will again be 
        offering free events and activities to encourage drawing in the Great 
        Court and many galleries. A special lecture by Gerald Scarfe and a series 
        of guided talks will highlight drawing across different cultures - from 
        Africa and North America to Europe and Asia. It is hoped that every British 
        Museum visitor will leave with a drawing they made in some medium - be 
        it pencil, crayon or electronic imagery.</font></p>
