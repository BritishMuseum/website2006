      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3"><b><font size="2">A 
        Rare Roman Reunion</font></b></font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">An exquisite brown 
        agate engraved gem dating from 35-25 BC depicting Octavian as the god 
        Mercury - so important that the government put a temporary bar on its 
        export - has been bought by the British Museum with the help of a £96,000 
        grant from art charity the National Art Collections Fund (The Art Fund), 
        and the British Museum Friends. <br wp="BR1">
        <br wp="BR2">
        The purchase is particularly important as the gem can now be reunited 
        with its pair, already in the Museum's collections, an almost identical 
        gem which probably depicts Octavian's sister Octavia as the goddess Diana. 
        The two gem will go on display together for the first time in over 300 
        years as part of the upcoming exhibition <em>Cleopatra of Egypt: From 
        History to Myth</em>, which opens on 12 April. Octavian defeated Cleopatra 
        and her lover Mark Antony at the battle of Actium, 31 BC and it has been 
        suggested that the gems may have been commissioned to mark this famous 
        victory.<br wp="BR1">
        <br wp="BR2">
        The piece, which measures just 4.5cm by 2.9cm, was bought for £120,000, 
        a price that reflects its extraordinary rarity and value. From 1781 it 
        had formed part of the Duke of Marlborough's renowned ancient gem collection. 
        In 1909 it was bought at auction by Victorian art benefactor A.C. Ionides, 
        and since that time it has been in private hands.<br wp="BR1">
        <br wp="BR2">
        The engraving is attributed to gem-cutter Solon, one of the Greek artists 
        employed by Octavian from around 40BC onwards. His work best reflects 
        the transition of Greek Hellenistic to Roman Imperial art and the piece 
        is described by British Museum curators as one of the craftsman's very 
        finest. David Barrie, Director of the Art Fund said "Opportunities to 
        acquire pieces of this quality and importance to do not come along often. 
        In securing this exquisite jewel, the Art Fund and the British Museum 
        are reuniting the portraits of the Emperor and Empress after hundreds 
        of years apart."</font></p>

      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">This brings the total 
        of Art Fund grants to the British Museum to over £200,000 in 2000. These 
        grants have gone towards the purchase of works ranging from Picasso proofs, 
        a medieval gold figurine found on a Hertfordshire farm, and a magnificent 
        carved head of the Empress Livia as the goddess Ceres. Another major grant 
        was recently given for the purchase of the Spratt Aphrodite, a fine marble 
        sculpture dating from the second century BC, found at Knossos in Crete.
