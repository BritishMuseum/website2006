        Celtic Warrior Brooch Acquired for The British Museum</b></font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The British Museum, 
        with help from the <strong>Heritage Lottery Fund</strong> and the independent 
        art charity the <strong>National Art Collections Fund</strong>, has acquired 
        a magnificent gold brooch from the third century BC. The brooch is a unique 
        piece of ancient jewellery of the highest quality of workmanship and of 
        the greatest interest. A true masterpiece. It represents the meeting of 
        the Greek artistic genius and the warrior world of Celtic Europe.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The heavy gold brooch, 
        or fibula, some 14 cms long, is dominated by the figure of a naked warrior 
        wearing a Celtic helmet and carrying a Celtic shield, whose hunting dog 
        eagerly jumps up at him. It was probably made in the third century BC 
        by a Greek master-jeweller working abroad for a Celtic client, one who, 
        to judge by the long-footed form of the fibula, lived on the Spanish peninsula.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Greek craftsmen, including 
        jewellers, travelled widely in the Mediterranean and beyond from the seventh 
        century BC down to the second. This, however, is the only witness to a 
        Greek jeweller's journey beyond the Pillars of Hercules.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The local Iberian 
        fibulae of the same form are in silver and are decorated with a warrior 
        on horseback, accompanied by hunting dogs. In this unique gold version 
        the Greek craftsman has simplified the narrative to a warrior and his 
        hunting dog, who leaps up enthusiastically at his master, while the rest 
        of the hunt motif is merely hinted at by means of the boar's head, which 
        served as the sliding catch for the pin, and the other dogs' heads.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The warrior is no 
        doubt the craftsman's representation of the owner himself. We do not know 
        where the fibula was found, but its acquisition by the Portuguese Royal 
        Family in the nineteenth century would seem to fit well with a burial 
        in a princely warrior tomb somewhere in the Iberian peninsula.</font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><br wp="BR1">

        <strong>History</strong></font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The brooch was formerly 
        in the collection of the Royal House of Braganza and perhaps collected 
        by Ferdinand of Saxe-Coburg, consort of Queen Maria of Portugal. Most 
        of the jewels of the Braganza dynasty were inherited in 1919 by HRH Nevada 
        of Portugal, Princess d'Braganza and Duchesse d'Oporto. She emigrated 
        to America and on her death in 1941 the collection was sold by her heirs 
        to Warren Piper of Chicago.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The fibula was purchased 
        by Thomas.F. Flannery Jr in 1950 at the Warren Piper sale. After examination 
        at the British Museum in 1965, it was displayed at the "Early Celtic Art" 
        exhibition of 1970, held in Edinburgh and the Hayward Gallery, London. 
        From 1993 until 2000 it was on loan to the British Museum.</font></p>
      <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#000000"><img src="2001images/brooch.jpg" width="362" height="221" alt="Celtic gold brooch from the third centry BC"><br wp="BR1">
        <br wp="BR1">
        </font><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>Detailed 
        Description and Comment</strong></font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The arched bow carries 
        eight curls on its top, while the side panels are decorated with running 
        spirals and loops that were once surrounded by blue enamel. Each end takes 
        the form of a dog's head. The hinge or spring is lost, together with the 
        brooch pin itself. When worn, this pin would have been held in place by 
        the moveable catch-plate in the form of a boar's head. The long "foot" 
        of the fibula is formed from two thick wires twisted together that end 
        in the jaws of a dog with raised ears. Beyond a bead with spiral decoration 
        is the forepart of a rearing dog with flattened ears. The front paws of 
        the dog rest on the bottom of the large oval shield that is held by the 
        naked warrior who seems almost to sit on the arched bow of the fibula.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The warrior wears 
        a Celtic helmet of Montefortino type, which probably had a tiny horn on 
        either side. From a belt round his waist hangs a scabbard of La T&egrave;ne 
        I type, while his right hand grasps the hilt of a sword that had a three-lobed 
        pommel also of La T&egrave;ne type - the blade, now lost, must have pointed 
        vertically upwards. The spindle-shaped boss of the oval shield marks it 
        out too as of La T&egrave;ne form. The warrior's eyes, like those of the 
        animals were once filled with enamel, probably white surrounding a black 
        centre.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The form of the fibula 
        with its long "foot" and the addition of human and animal forms is best 
        parallelled in a series of silver and bronze fibulae from the Iberian 
        peninsula, suggesting that this masterpiece in gold was specially created 
        for an Iberian client. That the jeweller was a Greek is indicated by the 
        style and quality of the figured forms and by the technology of the gold 
        working and the enamelling.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><strong>Price - </strong>Purchased 
        at Christie's, 25<sup>th</sup> April 2001, for a total of £1,121,906.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">This purchase has 
        been made possible with the aid of donations from various sources, including 
        a grant of £577,157 from the Heritage Lottery Fund and one of £178,808 
        from the National Art Collections Fund. A further £363,000 came from British 
        Museum funds with a special contribution from the <strong>British Museum 
        Friends</strong>.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Anthea Case, Director 
        of the<strong> Heritage Lottery Fund</strong>, said 'This Celtic 'warrior 
        brooch' is an exquisite piece of jewellery which will offer visitors to 
        the British Museum a fascinating insight into the juxtaposition of Greek 
        and Celtic cultures in ancient times. We are delighted to have helped 
        the British Museum to acquire such a significant and beautiful brooch 
        from the 3<sup>rd</sup> century BC which will be enjoyed by visitors for 
        years to come'.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">David Barrie, Director 
        of the<strong> National Art Collections Fund</strong> said 'The Art Fund 
        reacted instantly to the British Museum's urgent request for a large sum 
        to spearhead their fundraising campaign. This is a true masterpiece - 
        a piece of mesmerising beauty and exquisite workmanship, that vividly 
        evokes the world of the Celtic warrior'.</font></p>
