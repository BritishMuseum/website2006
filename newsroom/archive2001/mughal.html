        World: Jewelled Arts of India in the Age of the Mughals</b><br>
        The Al-Sabah Collection<br>
        18 May - 2 September 2001<br>
        West Wing Exhibition Gallery<br>
        Admission Charge</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">A spectacular exhibition 
        of jewellery from the time of the Mughal emperors of India will open at 
        the British Museum in May. This exhibition will include some 300 pieces 
        from the extraordinary collections of Sheikh Nasser Sabah al-Ahmad al-Sabah 
        of Kuwait, most of which date from the reigns of the Great Mughals who 
        ruled India from the mid - 16th to the early 18th century. In addition 
        to extravagant jewellery, such as earrings, pendants, finger-rings and 
        bracelets, the exhibition will feature daggers with jewel-encrusted scabbards 
        and hilts and jewelled boxes, cups and gaming pieces. The famous Ruby 
        Dagger, its gold scabbard and hilt studded with rubies, will be shown 
        along with many ravishing, but less well-known jewelled items.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">One of the highlights 
        of the exhibition is the collection of relief-carved hardstones, including 
        nine emeralds, ranging from 17 to 235 carats, imported from Colombia and 
        carved by the most skilled Indian craftsmen. The al-Sabah collection includes 
        a large number of gemstones with historical inscriptions and over twenty 
        royally inscribed spinels will be displayed. The most exceptional of these 
        is a 249.3 carat spinel ruby with six royal inscriptions, of which the 
        earliest dates to the reign of the Timurid ruler, Ulugh Beg ( 1447-1449 
        ). This stone, known as the 'Talisman of the Throne', was presented to 
        the Emperor Jahangir in 1621 by the ambassadors of Shah 'Abbas the Great 
        of Iran, whose own name is also inscribed on the stone. A few months later 
        Jahangir gave the stone to his son, the future Shah Jahan, and it was 
        eventually inserted into the famous Peacock throne. Such pieces not only 
        reveal the Mughals' love of jewels but also provide a dazzling introduction 
        to the history of one of the wealthiest and greatest empires of Asia. 
        Techniques will also be examined such as the characteristic Indian kundan 
        method of setting stones in pure gold which is fused at room temperature; 
        gold inlaying of hardstones and precious metals with hammered relief decoration; 
        and enamelling. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Uses of jewels in 
        the Mughal empire extended far beyond the simple adornment of women. In 
        fact, most of the objects on view belonged to men; although elaborately 
        jewelled the daggers and swords on display do not serve only as adornment 
        but are entirely functional weapons. The extraordinary skill of the Indian 
        stoneworkers is evident from the pieces on display and from larger undertakings 
        such as the Taj Mahal, built by Shah Jahan as a tomb for his wife, meticulously 
        inlaid with semi-precious stones. Shah Jahan was arguably the greatest 
        of all the Mughal patrons and was clearly a man who appreciated stone 
        carving in all of its manifestations.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">A member of the Kuwaiti 
        ruling family, Sheikh Nasser has been collecting Islamic Art and jewelled 
        objects in particular since the mid-1970s. Since 1983, the collection 
        has been on loan to the Kuwait National Museum and during the occupation 
        of Kuwait in 1990 the Iraqis took most of the contents of the museum to 
        Iraq, where they remained until after the war ended. Although most of 
        the collection was eventually repatriated, three of the most beautiful 
        early Mughal carved emeralds have never resurfaced, including one the 
        most important emeralds known to scholarship, another which features a 
        religious inscription, and a gemstone with royal Mughal inscriptions.</font></p>
