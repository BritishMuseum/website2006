        The Prints of S.W. Hayter (1901-1988)<br>
        </b></font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">27 September

      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The British-born artist 
        Stanley William Hayter was one of the most influential figures on 20th 
        century printmaking. As a printmaker he demonstrated the creative possibilities 
        of engraving, a technique that ever since the 16th century had been principally 
        associated with reproductive work rather than an artistic means of original 
        expression. After abandoning a career as a research chemist and geologist 
        for the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company, Hayter moved to Paris in 1926, where 
        the Polish artist Joseph Hecht introduced him to engraving. Hayter shortly 
        afterwards established a workshop in Paris, later called Atelier 17, that 
        became legendary for its innovative approach to printmaking and for the 
        collaborative spirit it fostered. Taking its name from 17 rue Campagne-Première, 
        the address to which the workshop moved in 1933, Atelier 17 became a magnet 
        for an extraordinary range of diverse artists, including Max Ernst, André 
        Masson, Yves Tanguy and Joan Miró, who were interested in exploring Surrealist 
        ideas of automatism and the subconscious through their prints. Hayter, 
        who was closely associated with Surrealism and supported the Republican 
        cause during the Spanish Civil War, advocated engraving as the most appropriate 
        technique for expressing these ideas. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">With the outbreak 
        of the Second World War and the closure of Atelier 17 in Paris, Hayter, 
        after a brief period in Britain working for a camouflage unit, moved to 
        the United States where he re-established Atelier 17 in New York in 1940. 
        This second phase of Atelier 17 saw a new generation of American artists, 
        including the future Abstract Expressionists Jackson Pollock and Robert 
        Motherwell, flocking to Atelier 17 attracted by Hayter's cosmopolitanism 
        and by the arrival of emigré European Surrealists from Paris. Colour began 
        to play an increasingly important part in Hayter's prints at this time. 
        His initial training as a research chemist led him to investigate the 
        different viscosities of inks and to develop a revolutionary method of 
        colour printing that allowed for the simultaneous printing of the engraved 
        or incised areas as well as from the surface of the plate - a technique 
        that avoided the necessity of a separate plate for each colour. Hayter's 
        technical innovations at Atelier 17 were propagated through his many publications, 
        including his widely used book New Ways of Gravure (first published in 
        1949 and revised in 1981) which became an overnight classic</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Hayter's activities 
        as a technical innovator, writer, exhibition organiser and influential 
        mentor have tended to overshadow his own achievements as an artist. In 
        a tribute to the artist's centenary, this display of some forty prints 
        offers an overview of his development and contribution as a printmaker. 
        In 1988, a few months before Hayter's death, the British Museum purchased 
        his personal archive of his prints, including many working proofs and 
        variant states, detailing his career up to 1960. The selection on view 
        covers the early years in Paris during the 1930s, the sojourn in New York 
        in the 1940s, and the period in Paris from 1950 until the mid-1970s where 
        Atelier 17 was re-established for the third time. </font></p>
