        This winter the British Museum presents a fascinating look at the other 
        life of one of the world's most popular writers, Agatha Christie - amateur 
        archaeologist. A special exhibition will look at how she became interested 
        in archaeology, how that interest affected her writing, and at the main 
        areas of excavation where she worked. Another section captures the lifestyle 
        of the archaeologist in the first half of the twentieth century. The exhibition 
        was the original idea of Dr Charlotte Tr&uuml;mpler, curator of classical 
        archaeology at the Ruhrland Museum in Essen, Germany.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> </font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Agatha 
        Christie originally became interested in archaeology on a spur of the 
        moment visit to the site of Ur in 1928. It was at Ur that she met her 
        future husband, Max Mallowan, and through him, that she became involved 
        in excavation of the sites that were to make his name. Agatha was greatly 
        devoted to her husband and did everything she could to nurture his career, 
        accompanying him on digs and fulfilling the role of junior assistant: 
        cleaning and repairing objects, particularly ivories, matching pottery 
        fragments, and cataloguing finds. She became very expert, and was much 
        respected by Max's colleagues for her painstaking and skilled work. She 
        was also much loved for her kindness and wonderful cuisine: only on Mallowan 
        digs were there chocolate &eacute;clairs and vanilla souffl&eacute;s. 
        In between her professional and domestic tasks, she found time to write, 
        and some of her best known books are based on that other life of hers 
        in the Middle East: <em>Murder on the Orient Express, Death on the Nile, 
        Appointment with Death </em>and of course <em>Murder in Mesopotamia</em>. 
        She also left a unique record of the excavations themselves, very early 
        home movies which capture the mood and excitement of the digs.</font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><br wp="BR1">
        <br wp="BR2">
        </font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The work of 
        Max Mallowan is also examined through his main areas of excavation: Ur 
        (where he was trained by the great Leonard Woolley), Nineveh, sites in 
        north eastern Syria including the massive mound of Tell Brak, and of course 
        the site with which he is most closely associated, Nimrud, where a fabulous 
        collection of ivories was discovered, some of which will be on display.</font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><br wp="BR1">
        <br wp="BR2">
        </font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Although only 
        half a century ago, the lives of archaeologists in the 1930s, 1940s, and 
        1950s, seem to belong to a different age. Travelling overland to the sites 
        by impossibly romantic trains such as the Orient Express or the Taurus 
        Express to remote and exotic stations such as Aleppo, Baghdad or indeed 
        Ur Junction, their journeys are at one and the same time luxurious and 
        primitive. A sleeping compartment from an Orient Express train of the 
        period shows how comfortable it was, provided no murderer was aboard. 
        Posters, luggage labels and menu cards fill in the details. </font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><br wp="BR1">
        <br wp="BR2">
        </font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The exhibition 
        will feature a mixture of artefacts from serious archaeological finds 
        to interesting ephemera. Visitors will be able to see anything from a 
        1930s hypodermic syringe (useful for disposing of an overbearing mother 
        who had an <em>Appointment with Death</em> at Petra), to costumes used 
        in <em>Death on the Nile</em>, to an archetypal Tell Halaf pot, crucial 
        to the chronology of prehistoric Assyria.</font></p>
