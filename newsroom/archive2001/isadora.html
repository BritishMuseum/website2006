        Isadora Duncan was first inspired by her research into Greek antiquities 
        at The British Museum to become the pioneer of Modern Dance. As part of 
        the Japan 2001 celebrations, renowned performers from New York, Japan 
        and London will present a centennial dance event in honour of Isadora 
        at the Museum, as well as an innovative public workshop exploring Isadora's 
        legacy alongside contemporary and Eastern traditions. Both the events 
        will celebrate Isadora's achievements and continuing influence by intertwining 
        classical and contemporary dance traditions from both East and West.</font></p>

        Duncan from East and West</b>, dance performance and discussion, BP Lecture 
        Theatre,17:30 - 20:00, Saturday 22 September 2001. Admission free (No 
        booking required). The evening starts with a performance by Michiyo Sato, 
        acclaimed dancer-choreographer and ambassador to Japan for the IDII. Michiyo 
        will be performing "Hikaru: Emerging light" using Isadora's famous 'myth-movement' 
        approach interweaved with movements inspired by Amaterasu, the primordial 
        Japanese Sun Goddess. Wearing an authentic reconstruction of a traditional 
        costume from 3rd century Japan (designed by the Asian costume scholar 
        Eiju Kobori), Michiyo will be accompanied by acclaimed San Francisco composer 
        and violinist Aenea Mizushima Keyes. For the second performance Michiyo 
        will be joined by Jeanne Bresciani, the Artistic Director of IDII, in 
        an interpretation of some of Isadora's original choreographies including 
        Schubert's "Ave Maria", Chopin's "Narcissus", Gluck's "Dances of the Furies", 
        Wagner's "Liebestod" and Scriabin's "Revolutionary Etude". Finally, there 
        will be a panel discussion, "Isadora Duncan and the Universal Language 
        of Movement", where the dancers and composer will be joined by internationally 
        renowned London artist, David Medalla, who will show video footage of 
        his own performances. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Isadora Duncan herself 
        was influenced by traditions from both the East and the West, and the 
        East and West pay tribute to her continuing inspiration at these dance 
        and workshop centennial events. The artists have featured widely in the 
        US media in particular and their work has been seen in venues around the 
        world including the United Nations building in New York, the Lincoln Center, 
        Carnegie Hall, the National Museum Of Dance in Saratoga Springs as well 
        as the International Arts Festival in Baltchik, Bulgaria and the Tama 
        Art University Museum in Japan, which holds the largest grouping of art 
        and archival treasures relating to the life of Isadora.</font></p>
