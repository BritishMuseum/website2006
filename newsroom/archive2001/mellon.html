      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Mellon Foundation 
        Award For Digitisation Of Silk Road Paintings </b></font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The British Museum's 
        Department of Oriental Antiquities is delighted to announce an award from 
        the Andrew W Mellon Foundation which will enable it to create a new digitised 
        database to make its outstanding collection of around three hundred paintings 
        from Cave 17 in the Caves of the Thousand Buddhas, Dunhuang, accessible 
        both to members of the public and to scholars working in the field of 
        Chinese Central Asia. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">This collection was 
        acquired by Marc Aurel Stein (1862 - 1933) early this century during his 
        second expedition to Chinese Central Asia (1906-9). The generous grant 
        will enable us to create a database of the paintings which Stein acquired 
        from Dunhuang.The database will be accessible within the Museum and will 
        be added to the Mellon International Dunhuang Archive (MIDA). It is planned 
        that it will also be available on the internet and integrated to the British 
        Library's International Dunhuang Project (IDP). </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The MIDA is a unique 
        scholarly resource including two and three-dimensional images of the Dunhuang 
        Buddhist caves - which are decorated from floor to ceiling with murals 
        and painted statues - linked with digital images of a selection of the 
        artefacts and manuscripts found at Dunhuang and now stored in institutions 
        worldwide. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">MIDA complements the 
        IDP at the British Library, a highly-praised digital resource which is 
        reuniting on the web (at idp.bl.uk) the tens of thousands of manuscripts 
        accidentally discovered in 1900 in a secret library cave at Dunhuang. 
        The addition of the British Museum's collection of highly important paintings, 
        mostly dating to the 9th and 10th centuries AD, will enhance both databases 
        and further understanding of this unique collection of material which 
        is of outstanding importance in the history of Chinese Buddhist art. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">A permanent display 
        of objects from Dunhuang in our exhibition galleries cannot be permitted 
        for conservation reasons and viewing items from the collection has had 
        to be limited because of their fragility. Although the major portion of 
        the collection has been published in works of reference, these publications 
        are now out of print. The Mellon grant for digitising the British Museum's 
        collection will therefore enable a whole new audience to become familiar 
        with this material and to access it in a more detailed fashion than is 
        physically possible with the paintings themselves. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The funding from the 
        Mellon Foundation will prove valuable to scholars, educators and everyone 
        interested in the history of the Silk Road and its culture. It is hoped 
        that after the successful digitisation of the paintings, the textiles 
        and other three dimensional material belonging to this collection in the 
        British Museum will be digitised in similar fashion.</font></p>
