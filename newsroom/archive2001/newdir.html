        at The British Museum</b></font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The British Museum 
        will advertise for a new Director on Sunday 9 September as the Trustees 
        seek a dynamic figure to lead the Museum and to build on its achievements 
        and international reputation in the approach to the 250th anniversary 
        in 2003. </font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The 
        new Director will take unitary responsibility for both academic and managerial 
        matters.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The current Director, 
        Dr Robert Anderson's contract expires in June 2002 and the Trustees have 
        accepted the resignation of Managing Director Suzanna Taverne with six 
        months notice.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Consultants Saxton 
        Bampfylde Hever have been charged with undertaking an international search 
        to ensure that a wide range of possible candidates is considered. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The election of Sir 
        John Boyd, as chairman designate of the Museum's Board of Trustees was 
        brought forward so he could chair the search committee prior to taking 
        over from Graham Greene as Chairman on 1 July 2002.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> "The Trustees are 
        seeking a Director who combines cultural authority and managerial capability," 
        said Sir John. "We want strong and active leadership together with strategic 
        vision. Applications from a variety of relevant backgrounds are being 
        encouraged. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"The British Museum 
        has a broad mandate and multiple responsibilities to the public as a visitor 
        experience and a centre for education and research. The new Director will 
        build on the success of the Great Court to develop our role as a major 
        international institution as we look towards and beyond the 250th anniversary 
        in 2003." </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Suzanna Taverne said, 
        "My resignation clears the way for the new appointment and I shall be 
        working out my notice with full commitment.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> "I have thoroughly 
        enjoyed working at this great institution, managing the Museum through 
        a challenging period and playing my part in the opening of the Great Court, 
        which has received wide public acclaim," she added. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"Suzanna Taverne has 
        played a critical role in ensuring effective management in the final phase 
        of our millennium project," said Graham Greene. "The dual management was 
        necessary during this period leading up to the opening of the Great Court: 
        its success is a tribute to all concerned."</font></p>
