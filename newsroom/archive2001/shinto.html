      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Shinto: The Sacred 
        Art of Ancient Japan</b><br>
        5 September - 2 December 2001<br>
        Room 91-94<br>
        Admission Charge </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">One of the leading 
        events of Japan 2001, this exhibition features an extraordinary range 
        of art and artefacts associated with the Shintô religion. Shintô is the 
        indigenous religion of Japan, more commonly observed in the contemporary 
        social life and motivations of the Japanese people, than in a pattern 
        of formal belief or philosophy. The exhibition is the first of its kind 
        in Europe with important loan material from over 70 shrines, temples and 
        museum collections on display including several National Treasures, key 
        items from the great Shintô shrine of Ise and from the Imperial Household 
        Collection itself. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The world of Shintô 
        will be examined retrospectively, beginning in the 15th century and travelling 
        back in time, culminating in the deep mysteries of prehistoric Japan. 
        The visual iconography of the Muromachi ( 1333-1568 ) Kamakura ( 1185-1333 
        ) and Heian ( 794-1185 ) periods will be displayed via magnificent wood 
        sculptures and paintings that depict Shintô deities and their Buddhist 
        hybrids. A key object from the medieval period is the representation on 
        silk of the deer mandala, the embodiment of the Kasuga shrine, from the 
        Nara National Museum. A Nô mask of an aged red-headed woman indicates 
        the development of this classical drama form in the Kamakura period while 
        a wooden model of a horse from the same period shows the continuation 
        of the Kofun custom initiated by the Korean king of donating live horses 
        to shrines. The Kofun ( 300 - 7th century ) period itself saw the introduction 
        of iron production and the iron sword, bronze mirror and the jewel were 
        subsequently adopted as the three sacred objects of Shintô. One of the 
        6th century mirrors on display features Shintô shrine buildings in the 
        form of store-houses. The Chinese introduction of bronze technology to 
        Japan during the Yayoi ( 300BC-AD300 ) period led to bronze being accorded 
        holy status and bronze artefacts have been found ritually buried in early 
        centres of power. Decorations on a bronze bell ( dtaku ) shows aspects 
        of the rice culture that has greatly influenced Shintô practice. Japan's 
        uncharted prehistory, the Jmon period (10,000-300BC ) will also be examined 
        through an impressive array of ceramics, including intricate 'flaming 
        pots', decorated with human and animal forms. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">One of the most remarkable 
        aspects of the exhibition is the near perfect condition of the objects 
        on display, even those that are centuries old, by virtue of the belief 
        that they were the properties of the gods and therefore rarely handled 
        by mortals. Shintô, primarily a form of nature worship where natural objects 
        are revered and personified, also encourages reverence for the spiritual 
        elements in material objects. A key belief of Shint is that<i> kami</i> 
        ( spirits ) must be coaxed into inviting vessels if they are to materialise 
        in the service of the living. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The exhibition has 
        been made possible by Japan's Agency for Cultural Affairs and the Japan 
        Foundation with the assistance of Japan Airlines. Sponsored by Asahi Shimbun.

      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">To accompany the exhibition, 
        the British Museum, in association with The Japan Foundation, is organising 
        a symposium designed to enhance understanding and appreciation of the 
        exhibition through a series of wide-ranging lectures. Japanese and non-Japanese 
        specialist speakers will examine the aspects of Shintô arts covered in 
        the exhibition as well as looking at the archaeological, spiritual and 
        cultural background of Shintô ( with simultaneous translation ). For further 
        information please contact the Press Office on 020 7323 8522.</font></p>
