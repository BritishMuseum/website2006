        Museum Acquires Jennings Dog</b></font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The British Museum 
        is delighted to announce that it has raised the funds necessary for the 
        purchase of the Jennings Dog. The rare Roman sculpture from the 2<sup>nd</sup> 
        century AD will now remain in Britain thanks to the generosity of the 
        Heritage Lottery Fund, the National Art Collections Fund (The Art Fund), 
        the British Museum Friends and contributions from the public.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The cost has been 
        met by public response to the campaign which has raised some £30,000, 
        The Heritage Lottery Fund which gave £362,000, £100,000 from the National 
        Art Collections Fund, £50,000 from the British Museum Friends, £40,000 
        from the supporters of the Greek and Roman department and £80,000 from 
        British Museum Trust Funds.</font></p>

        Greene, Chairman of the British Museum Trustees said:</strong></font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#000000"><strong><br>
        </strong></font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">' I 
        am delighted that the Museum has been able to purchase the Jennings Dog. 
        I am extremely grateful to the Heritage Lottery Fund, the National Art 
        Collections Fund, and the generous donations from the public, which have 
        saved such an important sculpture for the nation'.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><strong>Sue Bowers, 
        Heritage Lottery Fund Regional Manager for London said:</strong></font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#000000"><strong><br>
        </strong></font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"The 
        Heritage Lottery Fund is extremely pleased to have helped the British 
        Museum acquire this rare piece of sculpture. The Jennings Dog has only 
        once been on public display back in 1983 but will now be on permanent 
        exhibition at the Museum. It is particularly exciting that this sculpture 
        will be a 'touch' item meaning that visitors with visual impairments will 
        be able to fully appreciate the intricate craftmanship of this Classical 
        piece of art."</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><strong>Minister of 
        State for the Arts, Baroness Blackstone said:</strong></font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#000000"><strong><br>
        </strong></font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">'This 
        is wonderful news. The acquisition of this celebrated statue will not 
        only enhance the Museum's already world renowned collection of classical 
        sculpture it will also benefit scholars and visitors alike. The British 
        Museum is to be congratulated on its campaign to raise the necessary funds. 
        It appears the public have already taken the statue very much to their 
        heart.'</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><strong>Sir Nicholas 
        Goodison, Chairman of the National Art Collections Fund said:</strong></font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#000000"><strong><br>
        </strong></font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">'The 
        Art Fund is thrilled that its £100,000 donation was so central to the 
        success of the British Museum's fundraising campaign. As an independent 
        charity, supported by 100,000 art lovers from all over the UK, we, along 
        with the British public, have taken this magnificent beast to our hearts.'</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">It is intended that 
        the Dog will remain on display in the British Museum Great Court until 
        next year and will then move to the Hellenistic Gallery, before finding 
        its final home in the newly restored King's Library gallery.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Note for Editors</b></font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Dog is one of 
        the very few examples of a Hellenistic animal sculpture that was copied 
        in the Roman period, indicating that it must have been particularly important.</font></p>
      <p>I<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">t might, for example, 
        have been connected with a civic monument in Epirus in northwestern Greece, 
        for the Molossian Hound was native to that region. Epirus was sacked by 
        the Romans in 168BC and a famous bronze dog with local patriotic significance 
        might well have been carried back to Rome by the conquerors.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Henry Constantine 
        Jennings acquired the Dog in 1753-6, while staying in Rome, and commented 
        "A fine dog it was, and a lucky dog was I to purchase it". Jennings liked 
        to call the sculpture the Dog of Alcibiades - Alcibiades, a 4<sup>th</sup> 
        century Athenian statesman is said to have docked the tail of his dog 
        in order to give the Athenian people something else to talk about than 
        himself. Jennings's motive was probably much the same, for the Dog became 
        so famous in England that the owner was called 'Dog-Jennings'. It was 
        also admired by both Winckelmann and Dr Johnson, while to have a cast 
        of it was considered a sign of true gentlemanly taste.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> A collector and a 
        gambler, Jennings was a very colourful character. Plagued by debts, however, 
        he was eventually forced to sell the Dog in 1816. It was bought by T. 
        Duncombe MP and taken to Duncombe Park (designed by Vanburgh) in Yorkshire, 
        where it was placed in the Grand Hall until the 1980s.</font></p>
