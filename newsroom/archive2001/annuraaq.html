      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> The English word 
        <em>anorak</em> comes from <em>annuraaq</em>, meaning 'a piece of clothing' 
        in the language of the Inuit of the Canadian Arctic. Like other forms 
        of Inuit technology, Inuit clothing fascinates by its apparently simple 
        design and great effectiveness. This exhibition focuses on the clothing 
        made by the people of Igloolik, an Inuit community of about 1300 people 
        some 200 miles north of the Arctic Circle. It is situated in Nunavut ('our 
        land'), the largest self-governing territory of Canada. Established in 
        1999, Nunavut has a population of about 27,000 (85% Inuit) in an area 
        covering 20% of the Canadian land mass.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In Igloolik, where 
        temperatures are above freezing only in June, July and August, warm clothing 
        is of vital importance. This is particularly so for men who spend many 
        hours outside fishing, and hunting seals, walrus, whales and caribou. 
        Traditional Inuit skin clothing is well suited to this purpose, being 
        designed to capture air warmed by the body. In winter, when hunting or 
        travelling, two layers of clothing are worn. The inner layer has the fur 
        turned inwards towards the body, while the fur of the outer layer is turned 
        outwards. Warm air is thus trapped between the two layers of clothing 
        and the body, providing highly effective insulation against the cold.</font> 
      </p>
      <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> </font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In 
        Igloolik, caribou is the preferred material for making winter clothing 
        due to its dense hair growth and the hollow guard hairs that enclose air 
        which function in the same way as air insulation in the cavity-filled 
        walls of houses. The main garment is the outer parka or<em> qulittaq</em> 
        for a man, and <em>amauti</em> for a woman. The <em>amauti</em> has three 
        distinguishing design features: a pouch used for carrying a baby or young 
        child on the back, and a capacious hood and broad shoulders to bring the 
        baby to the breast for nursing without exposing the child to the cold 
        air. These two types of parkas are accompanied by trousers (two layers 
        for men in winter) and a wide variety of meticulously sewn skin boots 
        (<em>kamiik</em>), socks (<em>aliqsiik</em>) and thermal slippers worn 
        externally during the coldest part of the year. Finally, of course, mittens 
        (<em>pualuit</em>) are vital.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Clothing both sustains 
        and expresses Inuit identity. Its importance remains, although now largely 
        replaced by store-bought clothing. Not only are certain kinds of traditional 
        clothing still preferred over fabric-made garments, but the making and 
        use of clothing plays a significant role in keeping alive Inuit cultural 
        values and knowledge.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Much of the information 
        in the exhibition was recorded from Inuit elders by the Nunavut Research 
        Institute's <strong>Igloolik Research Centre</strong>, and the <strong>Inullariit 
        Elders' Society</strong>, Igloolik. The display will include both contemporary 
        and historic clothing and tools from across the Canadian Arctic, some 
        of which were collected by William E. Parry in the 1820s during his search 
        for the Northwest Passage, as well as comparative examples from Alaska 
        and Greenland.</font> </p>
