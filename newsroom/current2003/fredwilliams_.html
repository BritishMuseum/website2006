			<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Fred Williams (1927-82) is a key figure in 20th century Australian art, renowned in his native country for his singular vision of the Australian landscape. Williams remains little known in Britain however, but a recent generous gift from the artist's widow of seventy etchings and nine drawings and gouaches has enabled the British Museum to present his particular interpretation of the Australian landscape to a new audience.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Printmaking is of central importance in Williams's work, and no other Australian artist of comparable stature produced such a large and significant body of prints. From the beginning Williams's practice as an etcher closely paralleled his development as a painter, and a striking feature of his work is the cross-fertilization of ideas and motifs between his painting and printmaking.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">After five years spent working and studying in London in the 1950s, where his subject-matter focused on the music hall, Williams returned to Australia in late 1956 and realized immediately that he wanted to concentrate on the Australian landscape. Within months his distinctive vision began to emerge. Etching played a primary role in the development of his understanding of the subject, imposing the need to simplify and render abstract the motif.  Williams's portrayal of the timeless and boundless Australian landscape through a discrete language of marks and new compositional formats profoundly transformed the way in which that landscape is viewed today.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The exhibition is the first comprehensive show of Williams's graphic work to be held in the UK and is accompanied by a fully-illustrated catalogue published by British Museum Press and written by Irena Zdanowicz and Stephen Coppel. The exhibition and catalogue are sponsored by News International Limited.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Fred Williams exhibition is one of three concurrent Prints and Drawings shows scheduled for this period under the title Three Great Gifts.  Also on display will be David Brown's bequest of modern British works on paper including major gouaches by Roger Hilton, and a century of gifts from  the National Art Collections Fund ( The Art Fund ) by artists as diverse as Samuel Palmer, Tiepolo and the Chapman Brothers. </font></p>
