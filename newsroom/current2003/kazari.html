        and Display in Japan, 15th – 19th centuries</b><br>
        5 February – 13 April 2003<br>
        Rooms 91 - 94<br>
        Admission charge </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The world of <i>kazari</i> 
        is the vital, pre-modern world of decoration and display in traditional 
        Japan. This fascinating exhibition examines the dynamic and multi-sensory 
        development of Japanese arts over five centuries, focusing on particular 
        periods of high cultural achievement. Organised by The British Museum 
        and Japan Society, New York and in association with Suntory Museum of 
        Art, Tokyo the exhibition includes some 200 objects, many of which have 
        never before been seen in Britain. Important loans from almost fifty major 
        public and private collections of Japanese art in Japan, USA and UK complement 
        The British Museum’s own extensive holdings. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">According to one theory 
        the Japanese word <i>kazari</i> derives from the verb kazasu which means 
        ‘to adorn the hair with flowers’. It has since developed to be widely 
        used in contexts relating to decoration and display and is an integral 
        part of the Japanese language and traditional aesthetics. <i>Kazari</i> 
        does not conform solely to the Western aesthetic of ‘fine art’; it can 
        be applied to categories of art such as painting, but also encompasses 
        everything from ceramics to clothing, lacquer and glass ware, even hair 
        accessories. <i>Kazari</i> also governs the relationship between these 
        seemingly disparate objects when used together in specific cultural contexts. 
        The wit inherent in many of the designs suggests a sense of play, and 
        often implies something beyond what is actually represented. <i>Kazari</i> 
        extends to active participation in social activities such as tea and literary 
        gatherings, seasonal festivals or even a visit to the brothel quarters 
        as these events transmute the ordinary into the extraordinary. <i>Kazari</i> 
        is an ephemeral sensation that through surprise and splendour can take 
        you out of the everyday and elevate the mundane into the realm of the 
        sacred. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The show is arranged 
        into six thematic sections that explore the aesthetics of decoration and 
        display from the Muromachi (1333 – 1573), through the Momoyama (1573 – 
        1615) to the Edo (1615 – 1868) periods. The first, China in Japan: The 
        Shogun’s Court (15th – 16th centuries) features a recreation of an elaborate 
        guest hall display in the shogun’s mansion and includes examples of highly 
        prized Chinese art. Display was considered so important that illustrated 
        manuals were produced at the time to propound and perpetuate the art. 
        The Swagger of the New Military Elite (first half of 17th century), looks 
        at the more exuberant style of a newly victorious samurai class, depicted 
        in paintings of perpetual pleasure-seeking and expressed in ostentatious 
        costumes and exotic, vividly coloured tableware. Styles of the Merchant 
        Class (late 17th – early 18th centuries) focuses on the wealthy merchants 
        of Kyoto. The ‘Rinpa’ school personified by Ogata Korin produced screen 
        paintings of unsurpassed stylishness, and also applied their designs directly 
        onto other media, notably ceramics and lacquer ware. Fashions for Women 
        of the Warrior Class (18th - 19th centuries) reveals the lifestyle of 
        the elite women during the Edo period via fabulous lacquer cosmetic sets, 
        fine robes and printed books of etiquette and fabric design. The Floating 
        World on Display (late 18th – 19th centuries) deals with the licensed 
        brothel quarter of Edo (Yoshiwara) and Kabuki theatres where courtesans 
        and actors played out tableaux of living <i>kazari</i> to attract and 
        entertain. A newly conserved screen, Display Room of the Tamaya in Yoshiwara, 
        attributed to Utagawa Toyoharu, depicts the courtesans waiting for customers 
        and brings together a number of strands of <i>kazari</i>. The final section 
        Spectacular Festivals (17th – 19th centuries) examines the lavish festivals 
        in which fanciful floats and elaborate costumes allowed participants of 
        all classes to escape the every-day and indulge in riotous behaviour to 
        entertain the gods. </font></p>
