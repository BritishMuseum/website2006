                      do people around the world deal with life's everyday challenges, 
                      achieve wellbeing for themselves and their communities, 
                      and come to terms with death? The next step in the return 
                      of the Museum's magnificent ethnographic collections to 
                      Bloomsbury, this major new gallery of world cultures presents 
                      an anthropological understanding of the diverse ways people 
                      seek to minimise life's adversities - challenges we all 
                      face but deal with in what can be radically different ways. 
                      Generously sponsored by the Wellcome Trust, the biomedical 
                      research charity, and situated right at the heart of the 
                      Museum in the imposing space above the African Galleries, 
                      the new &pound;5.5m gallery forms the centrepiece of the 
                      Museum's permanent ethnography displays presenting a distinctive 
                      approach to the interpretation and understanding of material 
                      culture from all parts of the world. </font></p>
                    <p><font color="#002B55" size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In 
                      the developed world, wellbeing is often understood in terms 
                      of the individual, and especially the individual human body. 
                      In many parts of the world, however, there is recognition 
                      of the importance of relationships for sustaining the community 
                      as a whole. At the centre of this exhibition four case studies 
                      focus on ways in which communities ensure wellbeing by maintaining 
                      important relationships with their world and environment 
                      - with other people at festivals in the Pacific islands, 
                      with the animal world in Native North America, with spirits 
                      in the Nicobar Islands (Bay of Bengal) and with the earth 
                      and landscape in the Bolivian Andes. </font></p>
                    <p><font color="#002B55" size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The 
                      exhibition also investigates some of the diverse ways in 
                      which people protect themselves from anticipated harm, diagnose 
                      the causes of their illness and trouble, and treat their 
                      problems. It considers how people deal with death through 
                      burial and mourning, how they provide for the dead in their 
                      afterlife with goods and with festivals to cheer them, and 
                      how in some places people draw on the power of the ancestors 
                      to assist them in the world of the living. Displays in these 
                      sections include tarot cards, contemporary devotional objects 
                      from Germany and Italy, amulets from Iran and India to protect 
                      babies from harm, replicas of luxury consumer items from 
                      Malaysia burned as gifts to the dead and materials from 
                      Tanzania for treating and comforting those suffering from 
                      AIDS. Western biomedical approaches to illness are investigated 
                      through an installation by Susie Freeman, David Critchley 
                      and Liz Lee, Cradle to Grave, which presents the life histories 
                      of a man and a woman living in the UK by means of a spectacular 
                      display of the thousands of pills and medicines they consume 
                      in their respective lifetimes. </font></p>
                    <p><font color="#002B55" size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Living 
                      and Dying also presents some of the star objects of the 
                      Museum's ethnographic collections such as the Easter Island 
                      statue, Apocalypse figures from the Mexican Day of the Dead 
                      celebrations and gold masterpieces from ancient Colombia 
                      and Peru. Many of the objects on display were made to be 
                      used or performed - to be worn, given, swallowed or interpreted 
                      - rather than to be simply looked at or admired and the 
                      exhibition uses both images and text to indicate something 
                      of the life and movement that would normally surround these 
                      objects. If the displays challenge the notion that art and 
                      artefacts, especially as they are presented in a museum 
                      context, are self-contained objects to be contemplated quietly 
                      on their own visual terms, visitors will also be challenged 
                      to reconsider how objects and received notions in their 
                      own lives contribute to their personal sense of health and 
                      wellbeing as well as the strategies employed to bring illness 
                      and misfortune under control.</font></p>

                      Pharmacopoeia: Textile artist, Susie Freeman and family 
                      doctor Liz Lee, began to work together in 1998 and in that 
                      year won a Wellcome Trust Sciart Award that allowed their 
                      work to be developed. From 1999 collaborating with video 
                      artist David Critchley, the project became a touring exhibition 
                      comprising 21 pieces ranging from ballgowns and framed works 
                      to photographs and installations. Since the touring exhibition 
                      started in March 2002, several pieces have been acquired 
                      for both public and private collections, while new work 
                      has been commissioned for other one off or touring exhibitions. 
                      These include 'Adorn, Equip' national tour, Susie Freeman 
                      at Contemporary Applied Arts, 'Llistes D'Espera' tour of 
                      Spain, and for January 2004, 'Lies, Lust, Art and Fashion' 
                      at Podewil, Berlin. Many of the themes which emerge in Pharmacopoeia 
                      have been drawn together in the single major commission 
                      for the British Museum, 'Cradle to Grave'. <br>

                      The Trouble, sorrow, need and sickness section of the exhibition 
                      was designed by Andrew Gillon after winning the 2003 RSA 
                      Student Design Award for museum design (sponsored by the 
                      British Museum) while in his final year of graphic design 
                      at Duncan of Jordanstone College of Art and Design in Dundee. 
                      The glass panels include etched areas containing screen-printed 
                      poems. The images are on two layers - one layer printed 
                      on a transparent film and mounted to the reverse of the 
                      glass, and a back layer mounted to aluminium panels held 
                      in place by a steel framework 25mm behind the glass. The 
                      resulting composition plays with the layering of text and 
                      images and uses textural images and shadows to engage the 
                      viewer with the poetry. The two panels Trouble, sorrow, 
                      need and sickness signal the range of hardships that people 
                      throughout the world seek to protect themselves from.</font></p>
