      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b><font size="3">Universal 
        Museum</font></b></font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Eighteen of the world's 
        great museums and galleries have signed a statement supporting the idea 
        of the universal museum. </font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The 
        statement was drafted at their last meeting in Munich last October, and 
        presented to the British Museum for publication.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Their directors are 
        all members of an informal group of museums worldwide which meets regularly 
        to discuss issues of common interest.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">One of the most pressing 
        of these is the threat to the integrity of universal collections posed 
        by demands for the restitution of objects to their countries of origin.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Museums and galleries 
        such as these are cultural achievements in their own right. They bring 
        together the different cultural traditions of humanity under one roof. 
        Through their special exhibitions and their permanent displays they endow 
        the great individual pieces in their collections with a worldwide context 
        within which their full significance is graspable as nowhere else. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Neil MacGregor, Director 
        of the British Museum, said "This declaration is an unprecedented statement 
        of common value and purpose issued by the directors of some of the world's 
        leading museums and galleries. The diminishing of collections such as 
        these would be a great loss to the world's cultural heritage." </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b><font size="3">The 
        Statement and Signatories</font></b></font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Declaration on 
        the Importance and Value of Universal Museums</b></font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The international 
        museum community shares the conviction that illegal traffic in archaeological, 
        artistic, and ethnic objects must be firmly discouraged. We should, however, 
        recognize that objects acquired in earlier times must be viewed in the 
        light of different sensitivities and values, reflective of that earlier 
        era. The objects and monumental works that were installed decades and 
        even centuries ago in museums throughout Europe and America were acquired 
        under conditions that are not comparable with current ones.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Over time, objects 
        so acquired—whether by purchase, gift, or partage—have become part of 
        the museums that have cared for them, and by extension part of the heritage 
        of the nations which house them. Today we are especially sensitive to 
        the subject of a work’s original context, but we should not lose sight 
        of the fact that museums too provide a valid and valuable context for 
        objects that were long ago displaced from their original source. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The universal admiration 
        for ancient civilizations would not be so deeply established today were 
        it not for the influence exercised by the artifacts of these cultures, 
        widely available to an international public in major museums. Indeed, 
        the sculpture of classical Greece, to take but one example, is an excellent 
        illustration of this point and of the importance of public collecting. 
        The centuries-long history of appreciation of Greek art began in antiquity, 
        was renewed in Renaissance Italy, and subsequently spread through the 
        rest of Europe and to the Americas. Its accession into the collections 
        of public museums throughout the world marked the significance of Greek 
        sculpture for mankind as a whole and its enduring value for the contemporary 
        world. Moreover, the distinctly Greek aesthetic of these works appears 
        all the more strongly as the result of their being seen and studied in 
        direct proximity to products of other great civilizations.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Calls to repatriate 
        objects that have belonged to museum collections for many years have become 
        an important issue for museums. Although each case has to be judged individually, 
        we should acknowledge that museums serve not just the citizens of one 
        nation but the people of every nation. Museums are agents in the development 
        of culture, whose mission is to foster knowledge by a continuous process 
        of reinterpretation. Each object contributes to that process. To narrow 
        the focus of museums whose collections are diverse and multifaceted would 
        therefore be a disservice to all visitors. </font></p>
