                      is essential to a sense of identity. Without it we would 
                      have no sense of ourselves as individuals and no coherence 
                      as communities. To launch the British Museum's 250th anniversary 
                      programme, this special exhibition draws on the universal 
                      range of the Museum's incomparable collections to explore 
                      how the creation of objects has contributed to sustaining 
                      individual and collective memory. Founded in 1753 and therefore 
                      in existence for longer than most nation states, the British 
                      Museum itself will also be celebrated as a site or 'theatre' 
                      of memory for its many millions of visitors. Key objects 
                      on display include masterpieces from ancient Iraq, Egypt, 
                      Japan and Mexico, an exquisitely worked medieval reliquary 
                      made to display a relic from Christ's Crown of Thorns, the 
                      wax death mask of Oliver Cromwell, poignant Victorian 'love 
                      tokens' made by departing convicts for their sweethearts, 
                      gun-shaped coffins from modern Ghana and contemporary work 
                      by Osi Audu, David Hockney, Jock McFadyen, Susan Hiller 
                      and Peter Doig all recently acquired by the Museum and displayed 
                      for the first time. Particular highlights will be a specially 
                      commissioned Day of the Dead ofrenda or shrine created by 
                      the contemporary Mexican altar-maker Eugenio Reyes Eustaquio, 
                      which focuses on the BM's founder Sir Hans Sloane as its 
                      'ancestral' image, and 'The Memory Machine' - an interactive 
                      sound installation by Cathy Lane and Nye Parry which will 
                      be played back at the entrance and exit.</font></p>

                      the middle of the 18th century London overtook Paris and 
                      Constantinople as the largest city in the world with 700,000 
                      inhabitants. Trade flourished, building boomed and the newly-rich 
                      indulged in their favourite pastime, shopping. But London 
                      was a city of contrasts, rapid expansion meant fine houses, 
                      fancy silks and luxury imports on the one hand, foundling 
                      hospitals, crime, alcoholism and destitution on the other. 
                      In the midst of this tumult, Parliament passed the British 
                      Museum Act and brought into being the first national public 
                      museum. Over three hundred objects will give a flavour of 
                      London at this time; prints, drawings, jewellery, ceramics 
                      and medals will sit beside ephemera such as shop signs, 
                      trial admission tickets, condoms, foundling mementos and 
                      a set of spurs for fighting cocks. A first edition of Dr 
                      Johnson's Dictionary will be lent for the exhibition as 
                      will John Roque's vast map showing the extent of the capital 
                      in 1753 - an area which roughly equates to today's congestion

                      saw the entire compass of human culture and history through 
                      medical eyes, and amassed one of the world's largest but

                      posterity. Over 60 years after his death, this major exhibition 
                      organised by the Wellcome Trust Foundation will reunite 
                      for the first time an extraordinary range of objects from 
                      the heights and depths of Sir Henry Wellcome's gargantuan 
                      collection to provide a fascinating and unanticipated insight

                      collections to Bloomsbury, this major new gallery of world

                      anthropological perspective on ideas and practices associated 
                      with well-being and misfortune. From the rituals and ceremonies 
                      of Papua New Guinea to the masquerades of Bolivia and the 
                      &quot;scare devil&quot; performances of the Nicobar Islands, 
                      the gallery will provide in-depth case studies of four very 
                      different festivals associated with well-being from across 
                      the globe. Other displays will include star objects from 
                      the collections ranging from the colossal Easter Island 
                      statue to the enigmatic rock crystal skull, as well as contemporary 
                      art commissions and familiar everyday items. Through contrast 
                      and comparison, they will highlight that while encountering 
                      misfortune, illness and death is a universal human phenomenon, 
                      explanations, treatments and allocations of responsibility

                      much archaeological discoveries, often made by ordinary 
                      people, have revolutionised our understanding of our history. 
                      Magnificent finds such as the Mildenhall and Snettisham 
                      Hoards will be on display alongside more recent discoveries 
                      of the Winchester Hoard and the extraordinary Bronze Age

                      of the success of the 1996 Treasure Act and the Portable 
                      Antiquities Scheme which has led to a huge increase in the

                      Museum's 250th anniversary celebrations. The King's Library 
                      formerly housed the library of George III - now transferred 
                      to the British Library in St Pancras - and is the earliest 
                      part of the present museum building. A Grade I listed interior, 
                      it was constructed in the 1820s and remains an unspoilt 
                      architectural gem, the finest and largest neo-classical 
                      interior in London. By the end of 2003, this unique space 
                      will be fully restored and reopened as 'Room 1' of the British 
                      Museum. The accompanying exhibition - an intellectual complement 
                      to this historic and spectacular visual setting - will focus 
                      on the Enlightenment in Britain during the eighteenth and 
                      early nineteenth centuries, the great age of discovery and 
                      learning into which the Museum itself was born in 1753.

                      Enlightenment was a period of intense activity devoted to 
                      the study and interpretation of the natural world, the past 
                      and other civilisations. Classification, collecting and 
                      deciphering were all important stages on the way to understanding 
                      the world and the new exhibition will show how the British 
                      Museum was fundamental to this process and itself one of 
                      the Enlightenment's most potent achievements. The Act of 
                      Parliament with which the Museum was founded drew upon the 
                      Enlightenment's universal ideas to proclaim that all arts 
                      and sciences were connected and to make freely available 
                      the Museum's collection of 'natural and artificial [man-made] 
                      rarities' for the enjoyment and education of all. The exhibition 
                      examines this formative period in the Museum's history and 
                      explores how understanding of the past and present became 
                      more systematically organised, how voyages of discovery 
                      revealed new parts of the world and how archaeology, art 
                      history and ethnography became new rigorous disciplines. 
                      By displaying nearly 5,000 objects from the reserve collections 
                      of the Museum, along with substantial loans, particularly 
                      from the institutions that later sprang from it, the Natural 
                      History Museum and the British Library, the exhibition will 
                      enable visitors to examine Enlightenment collections and 
                      ideas as they were experienced at the time.</font></p>

                      act as a magnificent introduction to the Museum as a whole. 
                      Nowhere else in the Museum will such a broad range of the
