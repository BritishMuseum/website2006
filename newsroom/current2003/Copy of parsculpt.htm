                    are the Parthenon Sculptures always in the news?</font></b></font></p>
                  <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>What 
                    is the Parthenon and how did the sculptures come to London?</b><br>
                    The Parthenon in Athens is a building with a long and complex 
                    history. Built nearly 2500 years ago as a temple to the Greek 
                    goddess Athena, it was for a thousand years the church of 
                    the Virgin Mary of the Athenians, then a mosque, and finally 
                    an archaeological ruin. The building was altered and the sculptures 
                    much damged over the course of the centuries, and in 1687 
                    a huge explosion blew the roof off and destroyed a large portion 
                    of the remaining sculptures, when gunpowder was stored inside 
                    it during a siege of the city. The building has been a ruin 
                    ever since.</font></p>
                  <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">By 1800 
                    only 50 % of the original sculptural decoration remained. 
                    Between 1801 and 1805 Lord Elgin, the British ambassador to 
                    the Ottoman Empire of which Athens had been a part for some 
                    350 years, removed about half of the remaining sculptures 
                    from the rubble and from the building itself and brought them 
                    back to Britain. He acted with the full knowledge and permission 
                    of the Ottoman authorities. Lord Elgin's actions preserved 
                    the sculptures that were brought to London from further weathering 
                    and destruction from pollution.</font></p>
                  <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">These 
                    sculptures were legally acquired from Lord Elgin by the British 
                    Museum in 1816 following a special Parliamentary Select Committee 
                    which inquired fully into the legality of Lord Elgin's actions, 
                    with money voted for the purpose by the British Parliament. 
                    Since then they have all been on display to the public in 
                    the British Museum free of entry charge. </font></p>
                  <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>Where 
                    can the surviving sculptures from the Parthenon be seen?</b><br>
                    Sculptures surviving from the Parthenon are located in ten 
                    museums in eight different European countries. Most of the 
                    surviving half is roughly equally divided between Athens and 
                    London with important pieces elsewhere in some of Europe's 
                    greatest museums, including the Louvre and the Vatican.</font></p>

                    Parthenon sculptures in Athens</b><br>
                    Only some of the Parthenon sculptures in Athens are currently 
                    on display. Most have either long been in store or are still 
                    on the building and at continuing risk from weathering and 
                    pollution. It is hoped that they will all be put on public 
                    display in the New Acropolis Museum, when work on it is completed. 
                    There is no question that the Sculptures could ever be re-attached 
                    to the building itself due to its fragility and the continuing 
                    dangers of air pollution.</font></p>

                    Parthenon Sculptures in London</b><br>
                    All of the sculptures in London are on permanent public display 
                    in the British Museum, where they can be seen by a world audience 
                    of nearly five million visitors a year free of entry charge, 
                    in a specially designed, coherent suite of galleries which 
                    includes special features designed to ensure the sculptures 
                    are accessible for all visitors. The British Museum's MORI 
                    Visitor Surveys consistently show that the Parthenon Sculptures 
                    are seen by approximately 55% to 60% of all visitors and after 
                    the Egyptian Galleries are the second most popular display 
                    in the Museum. </font></p>

                    In collaboration with other museums holding material from 
                    the Parthenon, the British Museum is currently undertaking 
                    a pilot project towards a 3-D virtual reconstruction of the 
                    building. </font></p>

                    The following institutions also hold sculpture from the Parthenon:<br>
                    Vatican Museums; Mus&eacute;e du Louvre, Paris; Kunsthistorisches 
                    Museum, Vienna; National Museum, Copenhagen; Glyptothek, Munich;

                    is the Greek Government asking for, and why?</b><br>
                    The Greek Government is asking for the perpetual removal of 
                    all of the Parthenon sculptures in the British Museum to the 
                    New Acropolis Museum, which is still under construction. The 
                    Greek authorities believe that the Parthenon is the most important 
                    symbol of Greece's national identity, and are therefore seeking 
                    to reunite in Athens all of the surviving sculptures. For 
                    more information, see the website of the Hellenic Ministry 
                    of Culture (www.culture.gr).</font></p>
                  <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>What 
                    is the British Museum's response?</b><br>
                    The British Museum was founded by the British Parliament in 
                    1753 as a unique cultural resource freely available for the 
                    citizens of the whole world. In the British Museum the Parthenon 
                    Sculptures are an integral part of a world museum which tells 
                    the story of human cultural achievement. Here as nowhere else 
                    Greece's cultural debts to the other great civilizations of 
                    the ancient world, especially Egypt, Assyria, and Persia, 
                    can be clearly seen, and the vital contribution of ancient 
                    Greece to the development of later cultural achievements in 
                    Europe, Asia, and Africa can be fully understood. In a new 
                    Acropolis Museum the sculptures would be part of a local museum 
                    with a particular focus only on the history of ancient Athens. 
                    <br>
                    The Greek Government does not recognise that the Museum's 
                    Trustees are the legal owners of the sculptures in London. 
                    This makes it very difficult for the Museum Trustees to have 
                    serious discussions on the matter. The Trustees' title to 
                    the Sculptures would be upheld by any European legal system. 
                    The current division of the surviving sculptures between ten 
                    museums, with about equal quantities present in Athens and 
                    London, allows different, complementary stories to be told 
                    about them focussing respectively on their importance for 
                    Greece's national heritage and world cultural history. This, 
                    the Trustees believe, is an arrangement that confers maximum 
                    public benefit for the world at large.</font></p>
