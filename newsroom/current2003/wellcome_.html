      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>The Wellcome Trust 
        Gallery</b><br>
        Opening October 2003<br>
        Room 24 Admission free</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">This major new gallery 
        of world cultures, opening in our anniversary year, presents an anthropological 
        understanding of the diverse ways people ensure well-being. Everywhere, 
        people make exuberant and constantly developing responses to the difficulty 
        of life. People face illness, trouble and suffering, and deal with it 
        through faith, ritual, and specific restorative techniques. While in some 
        places well-being is understood as a matter of the individual human body, 
        in many places both well-being and illness are seen as a consequence of 
        relationships and community. Such relationships can be with other people, 
        with spirits and other beings, or even with the landscape itself. Four 
        case studies in the gallery focus on well-being and community, looking 
        at relationships maintained through festival in the south-west Pacific, 
        relationships with the landscape maintained through carnival and offerings 
        in Bolivia, relationships with the animal world in North America and practices 
        used drive away evil in the Nicobar Islands, Bay of Bengal. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">However people understand 
        well-being, in most places there are a range of culturally acceptable 
        ways both of averting harm and in identifying its causes and treatments. 
        Individuals select their own course of action from these options, in dealing 
        with their own personal circumstances. The exhibition also investigates 
        some of the diverse ways in which people protect themselves from anticipated 
        harm, diagnose the causes of their illness and trouble, and treat their 
        problems. It also considers how people deal with death through burial 
        and mourning, and how they provide for the dead in their afterlife with 
        goods and with festivals to cheer them, and how in some places people 
        draw on the power of the ancestors to assist them in the world of the 
        living. Material in these sections includes amulets to protect infants 
        from Iran and India, paper 'luxury' goods from Malaysia, burned as gifts 
        to the dead, Ghanaian coffins, and contemporary Native American materials 
        for treating and comforting those suffering from AIDS. Biomedical approaches 
        to illness are investigated through an installation by Susie Freeman, 
        David Critchley and Liz Lee, <i>Cradle to Grave</i>, which presents two 
        life histories in medical paraphernalia.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> If the Wellcome Trust 
        Gallery addresses these questions, it also presents some of the great 
        objects of the ethnographic collections. Objects such as the Easter Island 
        statue, the Tahitian mourner's dress collected by Captain Cook, and the 
        infamous 'crystal skull' are all included in the exhibition. All contribute 
        to answering the question of how we all deal with the real things that 
        happen in our lives. </font></p>
