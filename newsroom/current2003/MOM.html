				The Museum of the 
        Mind: Art and memory in world cultures</b></font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><br>

				Sponsored by BP <br>

			<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Memory is essential 
        to a sense of identity. Without it we would have no sense of ourselves 
        as individuals and no coherence as communities. To launch the British 
        Museum's 250th anniversary programme, this special exhibition draws on 
        the universal range of the Museum's incomparable collections to explore 
        how the creation of objects contributes to sustaining individual and collective 
        memory. Founded in 1753 and therefore in existence for longer than most 
        nation states, the British Museum itself will also be celebrated as a 
        site or 'theatre' of memory for its many millions of visitors. </font></p>
			<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The exhibition starts 
        with a consideration of the aides-mémoire produced in different cultures, 
        from the wooden models of wave patterns made by Micronesian sea-farers 
        to the mnemonics of the Inca and the 'memory coins' of 18th century Europe. 
        A section on 'living memory' looks at how people seek to influence how 
        they are remembered, or, in some cases, have erased or usurped the memory 
        of others. Images of people, particularly religious figures, who are recollected 
        and represented as if alive include icons of the Eastern Church, the Hinton 
        St. Mary mosaic - the earliest known representation of Christ - and a 
        huge stone footprint from Burma modelled on one believed to have been 
        left by the Buddha. Acts of commemoration are explored by comparing funerary 
        artefacts from ancient Egypt and Rome with sculpture from the Pacific 
        Islands, and imagery from modern Mexico, India and Iraq. A final section 
        examines the objects brought back by medieval pilgrims and participants 
        on the Grand Tour and leads into a consideration of photography and other 
        forms of everyday memorabilia and souvenirs collected and treasured today. 
        </font></p>
			<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Key objects on display 
        include masterpieces from ancient Iraq, Egypt, Japan and Mexico, an exquisitely 
        worked medieval reliquary made to display a relic from Christ's Crown 
        of Thorns, the wax death mask of Oliver Cromwell, poignant Victorian 'love 
        tokens' made by departing convicts for their sweethearts, gun-shaped coffins 
        from modern Ghana and contemporary work by Osi Audu, David Hockney, Jock 
        McFadyen, Susan Hiller and Peter Doig all recently acquired by the Museum 
        and displayed for the first time. A particular highlight will be a specially 
        commissioned Day of the Dead ofrenda or shrine created by the contemporary 
        Mexican altar-maker Eugenio Reyes Eustaquio, which focuses on the BM's 
        founder Sir Hans Sloane as its 'ancestral' image and echoes the Museum's 
        architecture in its own spectacular construction. Visual archive material 
        will also address the Museum's history and collected reminiscences by 
        staff will be juxtaposed with those of exhibition visitors who will be 
        invited to record their own memories of the Museum on The Memory Machine 
        - an interactive sound installation by Cathy Lane and Nye Parry which 
        will be played back at the entrance and exit. </font></p>
