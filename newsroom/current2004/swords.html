                      Japanese sword is probably the most deadly cutting weapon 
                      ever developed by man, razor-sharp and almost unbreakable. 
                      But apart from its efficacy as a weapon, in Japan, the sword 
                      has always been imbued with a spiritual essence according 
                      to both Shint? and Buddhist thought. Kend? (&#8216;the way 
                      of the sword&#8217;) is the spiritual study of sword-fencing 
                      which aims beyond victory in combat, towards the ultimate 
                      understanding of Buddhism. The sword is thus considered 
                      as an implement of enlightenment, and as such it sometimes 
                      has Buddhist invocations or depictions of deities carved 
                      on the blade. Appreciation of the beauty of the blade is 
                      an ancient and important aspect of Japanese aesthetics.</font></p>
                    <p><font color="#003366" size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">This 
                      exhibition features one hundred blades and mountings from 
                      the Museum&#8217;s extensive collection. All of the swords 
                      on display have been recently polished and conserved by 
                      a team of thirty-three specialists in Japan, with guidance 
                      from the Government of Japan and the Society for the Preservation 
                      of Japan Art Swords. The project has been generously supported 
                      by the Peter Moores Foundation. Polishing a samurai sword 
                      is an art in itself &#8211; each sword takes at least 2 
                      &#8211; 3 months to polish - and requires a long apprenticeship. 
                      This exhibition will provide the first opportunity to see 
                      these swords restored to their original glory, displayed 
                      alongside prints and screen paintings which depict samurai 
                      and their weapons.</font></p>
                    <p><font color="#003366" size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The 
                      curved sword of the samurai was perfected sometime during 
                      the Heian period (794-1185). It remained the major weapon 
                      in almost constant civil warfare between samurai clans vying 
                      for governmental control until the end of the 16th century. 
                      However slight changes in shape, length and appearance, 
                      affected by both fashion and technology have led to the 
                      recognition of three distinct types of sword: &#8216;kot?&#8217; 
                      (old swords); &#8216;shint?&#8217; (new swords); and &#8216;shinshint?&#8217; 
                      (new new swords). Kot? blades are generally slender and 
                      of a deeper curve than later swords, and was the name given 
                      to all swords made up to the late 16th century. The establishment 
                      in 1600 of a relatively stable regime under the Tokugawa 
                      clan (the Edo period) led to a new style of sword, &#8216;shint?&#8217;. 
                      The peaceful isolation engendered by the Tokugawa meant 
                      that the sword gradually became more a symbol of samurai 
                      authority and a fashion accessory, rather than a weapon. 
                      The emphasis was now on luxurious mountings, scabbards coated 
                      with gold or coloured lacquer, patinated metal fittings 
                      and minutely sculpted decorative motifs. Larger swords known 
                      as shinshint? appeared in the late 18th century as increased 
                      western naval activity roused the samurai from the complacency 
                      of Japan&#8217;s isolation. In the late 19th century, with 
                      imperial rule restored, Japan rapidly modernised and samurai 
                      were prohibited from wearing swords in public. All kinds 
                      of antiquities, including the now obsolete swords, began 
                      to be avidly collected by foreign visitors and exported. 
                      The Museum&#8217;s own collection arose as a result of bequests 
                      from this first generation of enthusiasts. However, by the 
                      time these swords reached the Museum, many had rusted or 
                      were broken as a result of neglect or mistreatment. The 
                      kind support of the Peter Moores Foundation has meant that 
                      the Museum has finally been able to restore these swords 
                      to their former glory.</font></p>

                      a sword is made:</strong><br>
                      Japanese swords are manufactured by heating the blade and 
                      folding a steel billet several times, then hammering to 
                      form a laminate, which is then beaten out into the final 
                      shape. It is hardened by a unique method of heat treatment. 
                      The blade is first coated with a slurry of clay which is 
                      then partially removed along the cutting edge. When dried 
                      the whole is heated red and quenched in cold water. This 
                      produces a resilient body able to withstand the shock of 
                      violent combat and a cutting edge of hard steel which can 
                      be polished razor sharp. When a blade is polished a grain 
                      formed by the folding process becomes visible. The crystalline 
                      structure of the hardened edge appears as a whitish line, 
                      the hamon (&#8216;badge&#8217; of the blade). The various 
                      hues and patterns within the hamon are described using terms 
                      derived from nature.</font></p>
                    <p><font color="#003366" size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>The 
                      polishing process:</strong><br>
                      The polishing process is no less important than the original 
                      manufacturing process. This often involves the use of more 
                      than twenty grades of stone, from the coarsest down to the 
                      finest. It is the unique nature of the Japanese polish that 
                      it reveals all the varied textures in the blade. Above all 
                      the polisher ensures that the lines of the curved blade 
                      are smooth and continuous and that the angles of the planes 
                      are clearly defined. The polisher produces a completely 
                      even surface, which not only renders the textures of the 
                      blade clearly visible but also helps preserve it against 
                      corrosion. The final stages of polishing involve the use 
                      of various powders, including stone dust and iron oxides. 
                      These processes are intended to produce a surface that reveals 
                      microscopic variations in both grain contour and crystalline 
                      formations. <br>
