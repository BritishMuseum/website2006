              <p><font color="#002B55" size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">As 
                part of a major new initiative underpinning its role as a museum 
                for the whole nation, the British Museum is taking its collection 
                on the road. Through 'Partnership UK', the largest and most wide-ranging 
                of any partnership scheme between a national institution and other 
                museums around the country, new acquisitions and established icons 
                from across the collections will travel on short and long-term 
                loans to communities around England, Scotland, Northern Ireland 
                and Wales. The aim is to make the Museum's unparalleled collections 
                accessible to the widest possible public throughout the country.</font></p>
              <p><font color="#002B55" size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The 
                first loan will be a recent acquisition, the spectacular Queen 
                of the Night, a 4,000 year old terracotta relief of a Babylonian 
                goddess of the underworld, which has been acquired with the support 
                of the Heritage Lottery Fund, the National Art Collections Fund 
                and the British Museum Friends among others. This masterpiece 
                of ancient Iraqi art will travel with Neil MacGregor, Director 
                of the British Museum, and Museum experts for a series of 'weekend 
                breaks' to Glasgow, Sunderland, Leicester and the Horniman Museum 
                in south London. This 'national roadshow' will allow visitors 
                to view this extraordinary object and listen to talks by experts, 
                experience Mesopotamian storytelling and participate in workshops. 
                The relief will then be loaned for extended periods to Cardiff 
                and Birmingham from September 2004 until April 2005. Subject to 
                local security and stability, the Museum then hopes to loan the 
                object to the National Museum in Baghdad. </font></p>

                tour and its accompanying programme, funded through the generosity 
                of the Dorset Foundation, has been devised in close consultation 
                with the partner venues. </font></p>

                MacGregor, Director of the British Museum commented:</b><br>
                'The Queen of the Night is a timely reminder that what is now 
                Iraq was once the cradle of civilisation. Writing was invented 
                here and Mesopotamia, the land between the Rivers Tigris and Euphrates, 
                was home to Sumerians, Babylonians and Assyrians. The astonishing 
                remains of these ancient peoples are an important part of the 
                world's cultural heritage and through this roadshow and future 
                activity, the British Museum hopes that people around the country 
                will have a chance to discover more about the past of a country 
                so much in the present news.' </font></p>
              <p><font color="#002B55" size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Similar 
                tours are planned for other recent acquisitions, details of which 
                will be confirmed later in the year. The exhibition Buried Treasure: 
                Finding Our Past is also part of this programme, the exhibition 
                will complete its run at the Museum on 14 March and will then 
                tour to Cardiff, Manchester, Newcastle and Norwich, allowing some 
                of Britain's most important archaeological finds to be seen across 
                the country.</font></p>

                  Queen of the Night is a large (49.5 cm by 37cm) plaque of baked 
                  clay, probably from a shrine, from Babylonia (central Iraq) 
                  modelled in high relief dating to 1800 - 1750 BC. It depicts 
                  a curvaceous winged naked lady, standing on lions and flanked 
                  by two owls. Various theories as to her identity have been put 
                  forward, the most likely is that she represents Ereshkigal, 
                  Ishtar's sister who ruled over the underworld. She is an important 
                  link to the reign of the Old Babylonian King Hammurabi (1792 
                  - 1750 BC), one of the most famous rulers from the Ancient Near 
                  East. Only two major works of art have survived from his reign, 
                  the Queen of the Night and the Code of Hammurabi, a stone inscribed 
                  with a law-code - the most complete early system of laws to 
                  have survived - which is part of the collections of the Louvre.</font></li>
