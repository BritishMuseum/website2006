                    (closed 8 August for a partial changeover of exhibits) </p>
                    <p class="style7">The creation of celebrity and fame is a topic easily understandable in today&rsquo;s multi-media world of pop star competitions, &lsquo;reality&rsquo; TV and Hollywood movie stars. But this is by no means a recent phenomenon. This exhibition focuses on urban Osaka in the late 18th and early 19th centuries, when the city produced superstar Kabuki actors and there was an outpouring of creativity in the popular theatre, visual arts, and poetry. The promotion of these stars of the stage was a collective process, uniting the actors with their patrons and supporters &ndash; on the stage, in poetry salons, in art studios and in fan clubs.</p>
                    <p class="style7">Single sheet prints, scrapbooks, printed books, paintings and ephemera will illustrate the passionate hero worship of actors by all levels of society. Wealthier patrons commissioned lavish special-edition colour prints with their own poems (surimono), while ordinary fans collected colour-printed &lsquo;likeness&rsquo; portraits of their favourite stars. Fan club members dressed in colourful matching costumes and headgear and performed hand-clapping and other spirited rituals in the theatres before performances. This is the first time that an exhibition of Japanese actor prints has focused so closely on the actors themselves, and on the cultural networks that supported them. </p>
                    <p class="style7">The core of the exhibition will cover the period 1800-1821 and present the fierce rivalry between the two Osaka Kabuki superstars Rikan (Arashi Kichisabur? II, 1769 &ndash; 1821) and Shikan (Nakamura Utaemon III, 1778 &ndash; 1838). These actors both participated in the creation of their own brand image and their rivalry, though genuine, was also advantageous in terms of publicity. Rikan specialised in classic male lead roles, whereas Shikan was more diverse, excelling in quick-change dance medleys. Shikan went on extended tour to Edo (modern Tokyo) three times in his career and, much to Rikan&rsquo;s disgust, was greeted by huge crowds each time he returned to Osaka. Rikan flatly refused to act with Shikan, even writing a formal complaint accusing his rival of gimmickry. With increasing pressure on them to appear together, however, in 1821 there was a grand reconciliation between the two and imaginary prints were even designed showing them acting together. Tragically, Rikan suddenly died before an actual joint performance could take place. Crowds equivalent to the entire adult population of Osaka attended his funeral, it was claimed. </p>
                    <p class="style7">The exhibition will feature loans from major museum, library and private collections in Japan and the UK, as well as major private collections in Europe and USA. It has been created in collaboration with Prof. Drew Gerstle of the School of Oriental and African Studies, University of London, based on research funded by the Arts and Humanities Research Council. It is organised together with the Osaka Museum of History and the Waseda University Tsubouchi Memorial Theatre Museum, Tokyo, in association with the Art Research Centre, Ritsumeikan University, Kyoto.</p>

&bull; From 8-10 September, leading Osaka Kabuki actor Nakamura Ganjir&ocirc; III will visit the UK for a lecture at SOAS and two performances at the British Museum. Designated a Living National Treasure by the Government of Japan, his artistic descent is traced directly from Shikan (Nakamura Utaemon III), one of the rival actors featured in the exhibition.</p></td>
