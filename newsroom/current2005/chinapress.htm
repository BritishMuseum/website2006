  </span><strong>The British Museum and the V&amp;A in historic partnerships <br>
                    with museums across China</strong><br>
                    <br>
                    <strong>Tuesday 6 September</strong><br>                    <br>                    The British Museum and the Victoria &amp; Albert Museum (V&amp;A) both announce today an unprecedented programme of collaboration with museums across China. Initiatives unveiled by both museums will enable objects from their unparalleled world collections to be seen in China and for masterpieces of Chinese culture to be loaned to the UK. It will also involve curatorial exchanges, skills sharing and joint projects which will benefit the museums and their audiences in both countries.<br>
                    <br>
                    <strong>The British Museum</strong><br>
                    <br>
                    The British Museum has today signed an historic agreement with the National Museum of China in Beijing, the first cultural agreement between a British institution and the National Museum of China. Neil MacGregor, the Director of the British Museum who is accompanying the Prime Minister Tony Blair&rsquo;s delegation to Beijing, signed the agreement with Pan Zhenzhou, vice-minister of Culture and the Director of the National Museum of China in the presence of the Prime Minister and the Chinese Premier Wen. It will guarantee a significant programme of collaboration between the British Museum and its Chinese counterparts. The first fruits of the agreement will be a series of loan exhibitions on world cultures not currently represented in museums in China, which will run from 2008 onwards. More details can be found overleaf.<br>
                    <br>
                    Neil MacGregor, Director of the British Museum said &ldquo;I am delighted to announce the signing of this historic memorandum which will cement an important partnership between the British Museum and the National Museum of China. The British Museum is committed to sharing its exceptional world collection with the world and this agreement will also allow many in China to explore other civilisations and ensure that the audience in London can appreciate the cultural achievements of China.<br>
                    <br>
                    <strong>The Victoria &amp; Albert Museum<br>
                    <br>
                    </strong>The V&amp;A is engaged in a series of Anglo-Chinese collaborations to 2010 drawing on its curatorial expertise in ancient Chinese art and encouraging an exchange of new design ideas between China and the UK. Mark Jones, Director of the V&amp;A, who is accompanying the Prime Minister Tony Blair&rsquo;s delegation to Beijing, announced that in 2008, to coincide with the Beijing Olympics, the V&amp;A will host a major exhibition, China Design Now, showing the best of contemporary Chinese design. He also unveiled a loan exhibition of 17th century Chinese porcelain from the Shanghai Museum to the V&amp;A in 2006. A collaborative exhibition in Shanghai to celebrate the Shanghai Expo in 2010 is planned, while the V&amp;A&rsquo;s retrospective of fashion designer Vivienne Westwood has just been staged in Shanghai in July 2005. An exhibition of contemporary Chinese photography and video will be at the V&amp;A in London in September 2005. More details can be found overleaf.<br>
                    <br>
                    Mark Jones, Director of the V&amp;A, commented: &ldquo;There is enormous interest in both our countries in seeing cultural treasures from the past as well as learning about the latest design ideas from across the world. The V&amp;A is committed to encouraging and inspiring creativity and the best of international design. These collaborations will help promote these aims.&rdquo;<br>

                    <strong>The British Museum in China</strong><br>
                    <br>
                    The agreement signed today ensures an unmatched level of partnership between the British Museum and China. The Museum will loan objects which shed light on the history of the world&rsquo;s cultures and in turn the National Museum of China will collaborate on exhibitions to present Chinese culture to the British Museum&rsquo;s worldwide audience. The agreement also taps into the wealth of expertise available at both institutions and the potential for cross-cultural and academic exchanges, providing an invaluable communication of expert curatorial and artistic knowledge. A series of planned British Museum exhibitions in China from 2008 onwards will showcase different world cultures, allowing material from other great world civilisations to be seen in China alongside the National Museum of China&rsquo;s own collections. This series will begin with an exhibition on Ancient Egypt, to coincide with the reopening of the National Museum of China in 2008.<br>
                    <br>
                    <strong>China in the British Museum</strong><br>
                    <br>
                    As part of the agreement, the National Museum of China has committed to loan a major exhibition of Chinese antiquities to the British Museum, which will complement the existing collection and programme of exhibitions at the Museum. The British Museum&rsquo;s long-term commitment to the display and promotion of Chinese culture is demonstrated by its permanent collection dating back to the museum&rsquo;s foundation in 1753. In addition to permanent galleries devoted to the display of Chinese material the Museum has always mounted temporary exhibitions with a particular focus on China, most recently, &lsquo;Mountains and Water&rsquo; an exhibition of Chinese landscape painting. The museum is currently committed to a five-year series of exhibitions of Chinese painting, highlighting this important Chinese artistic tradition.<br>
                    <br>
                    <strong>Other initiatives in China</strong><br>
                    <br>
                    In addition to the arrangement with the National Museum, the British Museum is engaged in many other projects in China. These include the touring exhibition &lsquo;Treasures of the World&rsquo;s Cultures - the British Museum after 250 years&rsquo; which will run at the Capital Museum in Beijing and in Hong Kong in 2006. And &lsquo;Assyria: Art and Empire: Treasures from Assyria in the British Museum&rsquo;, a major exhibition of Ancient Mesopotamian material planned for the Shanghai Museum in 2006. In 2007 &lsquo;Britain meets the World&rsquo; will open at the National Palace Museum in Beijing. The British Museum is also working with the Palace Museum via curatorial exchanges and skills sharing. The Museum has sent specialists to the Palace Museum to conduct a survey of the museum&rsquo;s European clocks collection and Chinese scholars will assist on the project to publish the British Museum&rsquo;s Chinese paintings collection.<br>
                    <br>
                    These alliances will complement the cultural and artistic spotlight that will be focused on Beijing and London, both host Olympic cities over the coming years. This provides a significant opportunity to promote the story and achievement of Chinese culture to the British Museum&rsquo;s worldwide audience, and to bring the British Museum&rsquo;s collection to new audiences in China.<br>
