        Joseph Hotung Great Court Gallery<br>
        7 December 2000 - 11 February 2001<br>
        Admission free </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Joseph Hotung 
        Great Court Gallery, a major new space for the Museum's special exhibitions, 
        will be inaugurated by a spectacular thematic introduction to the whole 
        range of the Museum's collections based around representations of the 
        human face and body. Over 100 objects drawn from each of the ten curatorial 
        departments will be displayed alongside one another for the very first 
        time, deliberately contrasted and juxtaposed to stimulate thoughts about 
        the intentions of their makers and the use to which the images were put. 
        The people and cultures represented will range over 14,000 years, from 
        the Upper Palaeolithic of North West Europe to ancient Egypt and the Near 
        East; to Benin, contemporary Africa, the Maya and the Aztecs, early Britain 
        and the Mediterranean, China, India, Australia, Jamaica and Japan. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Life-size sculpture 
        drawn from across world religions and cultures forms a focal point of 
        the exhibition, dating from a modelled clay head of 8000 BC from ancient 
        Jericho to modern portrait sculpture by Elisabeth Frink and contemporary 
        work by the Nigerian artist Sokari Douglas Camp. These full-scale works 
        will be displayed against a backdrop of other media where the human face 
        or figure is depicted, including ceramics, bronzes, hanging scrolls, banknotes, 
        recent hand-held sculpture, and drawings by Leonardo, Michelangelo, Rembrandt, 
        Picasso and Matisse as well as the Inuit artist, Parr. A colossal bronze 
        sculpture by the contemporary European artist Igor Mitoraj will also be 
        included. The first exhibition to examine representations of the human 
        form on such an ambitious scale, Human Image will set out to challenge 
        received understandings and to provoke debate surrounding the role and 
        purpose of the contemporary museum exhibition. No single linear narrative 
        will be presented. Instead the show will be organised around 10 suggestive 
        themes - Creation, Devotion, Perfection, Power, Abstraction, Drapery, 
        Guardians, Others, Portraits, Inscription - intended to offer a series 
        of overlapping and intersecting ideas which will enable the works to be 
        read from a number of perspectives. The theme of Inscription, for example, 
        can be taken as one way into the exhibition and the range of its artefacts 
        while offering leads into other sections. It will examine the decoration 
        and transformation of the human face and body to communicate fundamental 
        ideas of status and identity both in the ephemeral forms of cosmetics, 
        paint, jewellery or clothing and through permanent modification including 
        tattoo, scarification and the use of lip plugs. Body paint and modification 
        demonstrate a pervasive idea that the natural human body is incomplete 
        and requires improvement to attain social and physical perfection. Recurring 
        themes of idealisation, realism and abstraction will be contrasted and 
        juxtaposed throughout the exhibition. Human Image will show that depicting 
        and defining the body have been and remain a fundamental concern in the 
        communication of ideas and information across all world cultures</font></p>
