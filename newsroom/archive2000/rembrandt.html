      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Rembrandt The Printmaker</b><br>
        25 January - 8 April 2001<br>
        Prints and Drawings Gallery<br>
        Admission £6 (£3 concessions) </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Rembrandt was the 
        most original printmaker of all time. In no less than 300 etchings he 
        covered the full range of styles and subjects for which he is celebrated 
        as a painter and draughtsman, including self-portraits, scenes from the 
        Bible, vignettes of everyday life and character studies. The well-known 
        <i>Hundred Guilder Print</i>, the <i>Three Trees</i> and the <i>Three 
        Crosses</i> are among his most extraordinary creations. Famously experimental, 
        he often reworked and scratched at his copper plates to improve and extend 
        their expressive power. The results can look startlingly modern and continue 
        to inspire artists today. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Rembrandt's prints 
        have been avidly collected since the day they were made and over the past 
        two centuries the British Museum and the Rijksmuseum in Amsterdam have 
        built up the greatest of all collections of these famous rarities. This 
        major loan exhibition, the most ambitious display of Rembrandt's prints 
        ever mounted, will present for the first time the highlights of both collections 
        to provide a fully representative panorama of Rembrandt's achievements 
        as a printmaker, from their beginnings in the second half of the 1620s 
        until his death forty years later. Organised jointly with the Rijksmuseum 
        and curated by leading authorities in current Rembrandt scholarship, the 
        exhibition will show almost 200 impressions of these masterpieces of western 
        art. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The exhibition will 
        also be the first to present the results of important new areas of research 
        that have opened up in recent years, allowing us not only to follow the 
        progress of Rembrandt's work on each etching, but also to determine when 
        he revised the images. Many of his etchings can now be dated more exactly, 
        and individual states of his prints are now precisely datable for the 
        first time. The role played by Rembrandt's preparatory drawings and related 
        oil-sketches, several of which are included from collections in Europe 
        and America, is also now better understood. Providing an intimate glimpse 
        into Rembrandt's working methods and a new understanding of his conception 
        of his print <i>oeuvre</i>, these fresh insights will be presented to 
        a wider public for the first time. </font></p>
