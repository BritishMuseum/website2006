        </font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">This November, 
        the British Museum will host a showcase of contemporary art from Southern 
        Africa. The exhibition has been conceived in collaboration with the Gasworks 
        Studio and the Triangle Arts Trust and brings together the work of nine 
        artists: six from South Africa, two from Zimbabwe and one from Mozambique. 
        </font></p>
      <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The works on display 
      have been produced since the mid-80s to the present, marking a period of 
      intense socio-political struggle, transition and transformation in the region. 
      Mozambique gained independence from Portuguese colonialism in 1975 and played 
      an important role in the fall of (then)Rhodesia's white minority government 
      in 1980. South Africa held its first democratic elections in 1994, following 
      decades of resistance to the apartheid regime. However, all three countries 
      have since experienced internal strife and the path to independence has 
      been far from smooth.</font> 
      <p> </p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The artwork crosses 
        the boundaries between rural and urban, local and global, defying attempts 
        to easily categorise the continent into cohesive styles and traditions. 
        If they cohere, they do so in momentary flashes, in the overlap of competing 
        histories, politics and market places and in the everyday contact between 
        individuals. Each work may be approached as a glimpse into the biography 
        of individuals, communities and even nations.</font></p>
      <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Powerful pieces such 
      as Jane Alexander's <em>Harbinger with Street Cadets: Wish, Walk, Long, 
      Loop</em>, play on themes of apocryphal prophesy in the guise of innocence, 
      highlighting the apprehension about the uncertain future of South Africa's 
      young democracy. Reinata Sadhimba's <em>Pregnant woman holding her stomach</em> 
      combines elements of personal memory and experience (she lost six of her 
      eight children to the Liberation War in Mozambique) with social commentary 
      (on drought, poverty and war). Jackson Xidonkani Hlungwani's statue <em>Ngungunyani 
      Warrior </em>combines elements of his local history with Judeo-Christian 
      ideology and the natural world with that of the supernatural. Despite different 
      views of history and politics, parallels nevertheless emerge between the 
      artists particularly in their belief in the ability of art to change individuals 
      and society. <em>Voices of Southern Africa</em> therefore testifies both 
      to despair and to hope.<br wp="BR1">
      <br wp="BR2">
      The Gasworks Studio in London was established by Robert Loder who together 
      with Sir Anthony Caro, initiated the Triangle Workshop for artists in New 
      York in 1982 which was later used as a model for a series of ongoing international 
      workshops and exchange programmes throughout the world, including Africa. 
      In association with the exhibition, and with the generous support of BP, 
      the British Museum has funded three South African artists to take up residencies 
      in London.<br wp="BR1">

        Dube</font></b><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> ( b.1930, Gwanda 
        District, Zimbabwe ) studied sculpture at the Chirodzo Art School in Harare 
        from 1956-7 and then at the Royal Academy of Fine Arts in Copenhagen from 
        1969-70. He works mostly with 'Lusaka-marble' and local hardwoods to produce 
        predominantly figurative sculpture. He is also an accomplished potter 
        and his work has been exhibited in Africa and abroad, for example at the 
        Commonwealth Institute in London.<br wp="BR1">

      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Claudette Shreuders</b> 
        ( b.1973, Pretoria, RSA ) studied at the Universities of Stellenbosch 
        and Cape Town. Her portraits are carved from indigenous wood and combine 
        elements of Western religious icons with West African <em>blolo</em> and 
        <em>colon</em> figures. Her work is starkly autobiographical and confronts 
        the complex ambiguity of ( white ) identity politics in South Africa, 
        questioning what it means to be 'African' post-colonialism. Initially 
        her work focussed on people known to the artist, Shreuders' latest work 
        increasingly searches for iconic, archetypal characters. Her work has 
        been widely exhibited and she has participated in residences in London 
        and Kenya.<br>
        <br wp="BR1">
        <b>Noria Mabasa</b>, ( b.1938 Tshigalo, Ramukhumba, RSA ) after a brief 
        period in Soweto in the early 50s, Mabasa returned to the Northern Transvaal 
        and began to incorporate themes from local Domba initiation practice in 
        her clay sculptures. She has always tried to utilise the world around 
        her, often including people she meets or hears about in the media in her 
        work. She has participated in several international exhibitions and workshops 
        including the <em>africa95 </em>exhibition at the Yorkshire Sculpture 
        Park.<br wp="BR1">

        Mteki</font></b><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> ( b.1946 d.1999, 
        Harare, Zimbabwe ) was one of the founding sculptors at Frank McEwan's 
        National Gallery Workshop. By the early 60s he began carving in hard materials 
        such as limestone and granite, encouraging other artists to move beyond 
        working with conventional soapstone and steatite. Best known for his monumental 
        'hard-stone' heads which emphasise strength of character, his works have 
        been extensively collected internationally.</font></font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Reinata Sadhimba</b> 
        ( b.1945, Mueda District, Northern Mozambique ) participated in the Liberation 
        war of the 60s against Portugal as a carrier of arms for FREMILO. Encouraged 
        by a dream she turned to pottery to help her through this traumatic period. 
        Her pottery incorporates dreams and draws on the narrative Shetani ( spirit 
        ) inspired imagery of Makonde wood sculpture. In the early 80s she began 
        to incorporate beadwork and basketry into her pottery, which became increasingly 
        figurative. Her work has been exhibited across Africa and as part of the 
        <em>africa95</em> programme in England.<br wp="BR1">

        <b>Jane Alexander</b> ( b. 1959, Johannesburg, RSA ) and studied Fine 
        Art at the University of the Witwatersrand. She is currently a senior 
        lecturer at the University of Cape Town. From the 80s, her haunting apocalyptic 
        photomontages and life-size figures have powerfully reflected the violence 
        and paradoxical relations of an emerging nation. Her surreal 'corpses' 
        are built up from plaster on metal frameworks, their pallid 'skin' tinted 
        with oil colour and embedded with objects she has found ( animal bone, 
        horn, lace etc ).<b><br wp="BR1">

      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Jackson Xidonkani 
        Hlungwani</b> ( b.1923,Nkanyani, Gazankulu, RSA ) was taught the art of 
        woodcarving by his father. Ordained in 1946, Jackson has spent the last 
        40 years building a stone palace to God, following a series of revelatory 
        dreams. This sanctuary, New Jerusalem, is where the artist preaches and 
        sculpts. By the late 80s Jackson was a household name, using the sale 
        of his works as a means to spread his vision to the cities. He is about 
        to embark on a new project, 'the church for women' which along with 'New 
        Jerusalem' aims to unify all nations, both black and white.<br wp="BR1">
        <br wp="BR2">
        <b>Johannes Maswanganyi</b> ( b.1948, Msengi, Gazankulu, RSA ) learnt 
        his trade by carving household objects. By the mid 60s he was making figurative 
        shaped medicine containers, in keeping with Tsonga carving practice, many 
        of which are decoratively carved by burning into the surface of the wood. 
        He is also known for his high-gloss painted carved caricatures of religious 
        and media personalities and politicians, from Christ to Nelson Mandela.</font></p>

        ( b.1930, Dzanani, Northern Province, RSA ) began sculpting in 1953 at 
        the Siloam Hospital. He later studied carpentry in Pretoria and since 
        the 1970s he has worked on commissions for the ( then ) Venda Government 
        to carve drums, gun and snake staffs.</font></p>
