      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Gladiators and 
        Caesars: The Power of Spectacle in Ancient Rome</b><br>
        21 October 2000 - January 2001</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Bread and circuses 
        - panem et circenses - were what Romans demanded of their emperors, if 
        we are to believe the satirist Lucian. For more than five hundred years 
        spectacular events in amphitheatres, circuses and theatres, in an age 
        when the multi media we now all take for granted did not exist, were the 
        most important leisure activities of the masses throughout the Roman empire.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">This exciting exhibition 
        will look at all aspects of the entertainment industry in ancient Rome 
        and point up many surprising modern parallels, using objects lent by European 
        museums in addition to major pieces from the British Museum's own collections. 
        Individual sections will be devoted to gladiators and their fighting styles 
        and techniques, heavy physical sports, chariot racing and the theatre, 
        all seen from a variety of perspectives. The exhibits range in size from 
        a huge stone relief showing gladiatorial combat to the tiny bone discharge 
        ticket which gave a gladiator his freedom. In between are bronze models 
        of chariots, gladiators' tombstones, bronze and pottery figurines of gladiators 
        and wrestlers, stone busts and statues of boxers, theatre masks of pottery 
        and stone, a floor mosaic with a pair of gladiators, frescoes and stone 
        reliefs showing scenes from plays and a plate with a portrait of an actor.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Lavishly ornamented 
        gladiatorial weapons bring vividly to life the splendour and brutality 
        of the arena, while graffiti cut into wall-plaster celebrate long-dead 
        gladiators. Everyday objects such as oil-lamps and knife handles decorated 
        with images of gladiators, actors and charioteers remind us that spectators 
        then as today bought fan merchandise. The imagery of chariot racing above 
        all had an enduring popularity, partly because the rewards and hazards 
        of the race-course were seen as a metaphor for life. Circus scenes are 
        depicted on frescoes and other wall decorations as well as on the sides 
        of richly carved sarcophagi, while a terracotta plaque records with terrifying 
        reality the consequences of a chariot crash.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">2000 years on the 
        Roman games may seem remote in time, but their fascination continues. 
        This exhibition will show that they mirror many features of sport today, 
        not least in their intensity of public interest. The theme is strongly 
        represented in films. Many people have lasting memories of 'The Robe', 
        'Spartacus' ( telling the story of the most famous of all gladiators, 
        who led an uprising against Rome which symbolised the fight against slavery) 
        and 'Ben Hur'. To explore this connection a major film programme will 
        accompany the exhibition. There will also be an audiovisual presentation, 
        including computer reconstructions of arenas and an extensive educational 
        programme.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Gladiatorial games, 
        which had Greek and Etruscan origins in funerary celebrations and religious 
        festivals, first took place in Rome in the year 264 BC. In Rome itself 
        public holidays, featuring magnificent and costly shows, came to occupy 
        more than half the year. Comedies, tragedies, pantomimes and bawdy folk 
        plays were staged in the theatres; in the arena of the Colosseum, opened 
        in AD 80, gladiators fought in pairs or with wild animals to satisfy the 
        blood lust of the crowd; and hundreds of thousands of race-goers packed 
        the stands of the Circus Maximus to enjoy the thrills of chariot racing. 
        These shows satisfied people's need for excitement and hero-worship, just 
        as for example football, boxing and Formula One racing does today. Fan 
        clubs developed, bets were made, political issues were aired, the latest 
        victories and defeats were endlessly discussed, and brawling occasionally 
        broke out.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Politics were deeply 
        involved. The organisation of games came to be part and parcel of electioneering 
        in towns and cities but was increasingly used as a means to consolidate 
        the power of the reigning emperor. The top gladiators, charioteers and 
        actors were folk heroes, and the power of their universal appeal was recognised 
        and exploited by politicians and emperors such as Julius Caesar, Augustus 
        and Nero, who used games to manipulate a sometimes volatile public, whether 
        to pacify or reassure at times of crisis or to achieve political ends.</font></p>
