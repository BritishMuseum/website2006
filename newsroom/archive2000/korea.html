      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Korea Foundation 
        Gallery</b><br>
        From 8 November 2000<br>
        North Wing<br>
        Admission Free</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Korea, which has been 
        very much in the news recently, has a long and illustrious history. As 
        Korea becomes a major figure in the world economy there has been a flowering 
        of scholarly interest in its culture. On 8 November, the British Museum 
        will open a new permanent Korea gallery, devoted to its collection of 
        Korean artefacts, which is widely regarded as the best in Europe. The 
        art and archaeology of Korea, from the Palaeolithic to the present day, 
        will be on display including fine examples of stone sculpture, paintings, 
        printed books, screens and folk art as well as ceramics, lacquer ware, 
        gold and bronze.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">A central feature 
        of the new gallery will be a reconstructed scholar's studio or sarangbang, 
        part of a traditional Korean house, designed and built by the renowned 
        Korean architect Shin Young-hoon. Korean master craftsmen will assemble 
        the studio in July and traditional style Korean furniture will be installed 
        in September.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">One of the most exciting 
        exhibits in the gallery, obtained through the Hahn Kwang-ho Purchase Fund, 
        is a plain white porcelain 'full moon' jar dating to the 17th - 18th century. 
        The design of the jar is quintessentially Korean, showing the strict Confucian 
        appreciation of undecorated vessels as well as the tendency for many Korean 
        ceramics to be slightly asymmetrical or imperfect in shape. This natural, 
        unaffected quality was greatly admired by British potters (such as Lucie 
        Rie ) and by the Japanese, who voraciously collected such ceramics from 
        early times, often using them in the Tea Ceremony. Another interesting 
        item, on loan from the Whipple Museum of the History of Science, Cambridge 
        University, is one of the only two known surviving 18th century Korean 
        astronomical screens. The screen shows how Western scientific ideas exerted 
        an influence on Korea through the relationships of Korean envoys with 
        the Jesuits at the court of Peking. Another screen, recently acquired 
        by the Museum using the Hahn Kwang-ho Fund, depicts a hunting scene in 
        a mongol style. Buddhism was adopted from China in the 6th century and 
        its influence is represented by rare pieces such as an illuminated manuscript 
        written in gold of the Amitabha Sutra dating from 1341 and a 13th century 
        sutra box inlaid with mother of pearl, one of only eight known surviving 
        boxes of its type.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">A separate section 
        of the gallery will be devoted to rotating displays of contemporary Korean 
        paintings, prints and ceramics purchased in recent years, with the aim 
        of showing how living artists are transforming ancient styles and techniques.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The new gallery has 
        been made possible by the generosity of the Korea Foundation, an arm of 
        the Korean government and by donations from the Museum's first Korean 
        patron, Dr Hahn Kwang-ho CBE.</font></p>
