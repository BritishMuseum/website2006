      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>A New Gallery: 
        Prehistory Objects of Power</b><br>
        Opening 28 March 2002<br>
        Room 36/37<br>
        Admission free </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">One of the defining 
        characteristics of being human is the creation of objects, first seen 
        some 2.5 million years ago at Olduvai Gorge, Tanzania. Artefacts gave 
        instant advantage in the quest for food and security, but these functional 
        objects progressively took on other meanings and values. They came to 
        symbolise human control over animals and the environment and signify relationships 
        with other people and the spiritual world. This new exhibition illustrates 
        the varied ways in which prehistoric objects, both the mundane and the 
        exceptional, could be involved in the exercise of power and control from 
        the earliest times up until the end of the European Bronze Age (800 BC).</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">From as early as 1.5 
        million years ago, during the Lower Palaeolithic period, flint tools of 
        exceptional size were created, such as the Edmonsham handaxe. Size in 
        itself had begun to matter for personal prowess, irrespective of the object's 
        utilitarian value. By the Upper Palaeolithic (35,000 years ago), ornaments 
        were being suspended on body and costume and the first inescapably non-functional 
        objects had appeared. From this remote time on, humans were both creators 
        of artefacts and authors of their meanings. The Upper Palaeolithic also 
        saw the development of sophisticated art represented by a number of exhibits 
        including the extraordinary Montastruc ivory spearthrower in the guise 
        of a mammoth. The artistic focus on animals highlights both human dependence 
        on, and spiritual engagement with, the animal kingdom.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">One of the gallery's 
        thematic sections - 'The Pursuit of Perfection' - explores the human desire 
        to invest artefacts with aesthetic qualities that go beyond the sheer 
        utilitarian and includes the ripple-flaked dagger from Volgu, France, 
        highly polished stone maceheads and the Sintra gold collar. The enigmatic 
        carved 'drums' from Folkton, sculpted balls from Scotland and the splendid 
        bronze horn from Dunmanway are used to make the link between high craftsmanship, 
        status and spirituality. Such aspirations also helped drive the search 
        for exotic materials such as callaïs (variscite), amber or jet.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Objects often served 
        to convey messages to supernatural forces - gods and ancestors - through 
        funerary offerings, as in the Barnack grave reconstruction, or votive 
        deposits, as in the Lockington and Arreton hoards. The ritual disposal 
        of valuables and the perpetual drive to assert status gave impetus to 
        the accumulation of wealth in later prehistory after the domestication 
        of animals, bolstered by the discovery of metals. Bronze Age artefacts 
        such as the famous Oxborough dirk, which was discovered by chance in 1990 
        set vertically in the soil, illustrate this later development.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Many of the gallery's 
        messages come together in its iconic centrepiece, the magnificent ceremonial 
        gold cape from Mold, north-east Wales, restored anew specially for this 
        exhibition.</font></p>
