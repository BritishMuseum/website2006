      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> This exhibition in 
        the Prints and Drawings gallery is a selection of smaller exhibitions. 
        Below are details of each of the smaller exhibitions. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Piranesi's Carceri 
        ('Prisons')</b><br>
        Perhaps best known for his virtuoso etchings of ancient and modern Rome, 
        Giovanni Battista Piranesi (1720B1778) also opened up new vistas in the 
        world of fantasy architecture, breaking loose from practical restraints 
        to allow free rein to his powerful imagination. His architectural fantasies 
        develop out of his early training as a theatrical designer in his native 
        Venice, but he invests the genre with a dark brooding menace that is entirely 
        new. The exhibition concentrates on the artist's celebrated Carceri ('Prisons') 
        series of etchings. These images of dark cavernous spaces traversed by 
        vertiginous walkways have a nightmarish quality that gripped the imagination 
        of Romantic artists like William Wordsworth and Thomas de Quincey. Their 
        influence can still be felt in cinematic visions of dystopian cities of 
        the future. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>The Satires of 
        Richard Newton, 1777-1798</b><br>
        Richard Newton worked as a print designer and etcher for seven years from 
        the age of fourteen until his early death. They were the years of revolution 
        in France and high anxiety among the British ruling class. Newton saw 
        the world around him through the eyes of a young man angry at injustice, 
        but bursting with ebullient, bawdy humour so that his criticism takes 
        the form of grotesque and hilarious caricature of greedy aristocrats and 
        pompous politicians. In addition to a number of new acquisitions, works 
        on display will include his famous depiction of inmates and visitors at 
        Newgate prison, his unique view of the interior of a shop in Oxford Street 
        selling satirical prints, and a scurrilous caricature of 1797 showing 
        the Pope kissing Napoleon's backside after his victorious campaign in 
        Italy with Prime Minister, William Pitt, lining up to follow suit. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>German illustrated 
        broadsides: from the 15th to the 18th century</b><br>
        Illustrated broadsides are single sheets of paper printed on one side 
        with woodcuts or engravings and text. These were sold for use in a variety 
        of contexts: for information, instruction, contemplation, and entertainment. 
        Displayed in both a public and domestic context, the broadsides were often 
        pinned or stuck to walls or even furniture. Though many thousands of copies 
        were printed in several European countries (especially Germany), their 
        unusually large size and fragility have meant that very few have survived. 
        The British Museum has between 600 and 700 German examples - a large, 
        highly important but little-known collection in which all sheets are rare 
        and many unique. They date from the fifteenth century, quite soon after 
        the invention of printing with movable type, until the eighteenth century. 
        A few major artists and authors produced broadsides, but many of the images 
        and texts are anonymous. Sheets will be chosen to illustrate a number 
        of themes including Religion, Death, City life, Peasants, Women, Jews, 
        Witches, and English history. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Hans Sloane's Collection 
        in Print and Drawings</b><br>
        Sir Hans Sloane (1660-1753) was the most tireless and all-embracing collector 
        in Britain in his lifetime. A doctor by profession, when his collections 
        passed into national ownership as a result of his will in 1753, they formed 
        the basis of what are now three great institutions - the British Museum, 
        the Natural History Museum and the British Library. This display concentrates 
        on his collection of prints and drawings which, from the insects of Maria 
        Sybilla Merian to the flowers of Jacob van Huysum, largely reflect his 
        central concern with plants and natural history. </font></p>
