      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Imaging Ulysses: 
        Richard Hamilton's Illustrations to James Joyce</b><br>
        2 February - 19 May 2002<br>
        Room 90<br>
        Admission free </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Richard Hamilton, 
        one of Britain's most innovative and original artists who first came to 
        international attention as the founding father of British Pop Art in the 
        late 1950s, has been preoccupied for more than fifty years with James 
        Joyce's modernist epic <i>Ulysses</i>, first published in 1922, the year 
        of Hamilton's birth. Joyce's revolutionary novel provoked a storm of controversy 
        upon its publication in Paris and was banned in the English-speaking world 
        until 1933 on account of its sexual frankness, scatological themes and 
        vulgar language. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The idea of illustrating 
        this complex, experimental novel occurred to Hamilton while doing his 
        National Service in 1947. As a student at the Slade he made numerous preliminary 
        drawings and studies with the view to producing etched illustrations to 
        Joyce's text but for technical and practical reasons the project was put 
        aside in 1950. After a break of more than thirty years Hamilton resumed 
        illustrating Joyce in a series of large-scale independent etchings during 
        the 1980s. Some of these are reworkings of the earlier studies, others 
        are completely new treatments. In the 1990s, with the computer as an increasingly 
        important tool in Hamilton's image-making, the Iris digital print has 
        recently joined the sequence of illustrations. Evolving technically and 
        intellectually over a lifetime Hamilton's images represent an odyssey 
        through the themes and ideas of his own career as well as those of Joyce. 
        </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">This exhibition assembles 
        all the studies and prints produced since the project began in 1948, most 
        of which come from the artist. The exhibition, commissioned by the British 
        Council, is part of a European tour which includes Ljubljana (Cankarjev 
        Dom Galerija, 10 June-16 September 2001), Tübingen (Tübingen Kunsthalle, 
        10 November 2001-13 January 2002) and Dublin (Irish Museum of Modern Art, 
        1 June -1 August 2002). For The British Museum venue, there will be a 
        special display of first edition Joyce books and ephemera from a private 
        collection. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The exhibition opens 
        at The British Museum on 2 February 2002, the 80th anniversary of the 
        publication of<i> Ulysses</i>. The BM venue coincides with Richard Hamilton's 
        80th birthday on 24 February 2002; it is the first solo exhibition given 
        to a living artist at the British Museum since 1974 when Henry Moore's 
        illustrations to Auden's poems were exhibited. A fully illustrated catalogue 
        written by Stephen Coppel, the curator of the exhibition, and designed 
        by Richard Hamilton has been published by the British Council and will 
        be available at the exhibition. </font></p>
