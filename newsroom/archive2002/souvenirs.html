        Japan</b><br>
        14 June - 13 January 2002<br>
        BP Ethnography Showcase (Room 36)<br>
        Admission free </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">As part of the Japan 
        2001 Festival, this exhibition will look at the phenomenon of domestic 
        tourism within Japan and the distinctive role of the contemporary Japanese 
        souvenir in highlighting and emphasising local and regional identity. 
        The displays examine the way the Japanese travel, the kind of souvenirs 
        they make and sell, the acquisition and exchange of gifts and their display 
        in the home. Objects such as amulets, plastic foods and phone-cards will 
        be used to explore the historical background of travel in Japan and the 
        themes of pilgrimage, regional distinctiveness and the visual representation 
        of place. The imagery and cultural references used on souvenirs are also 
        examined, inviting visitors to think about Japanese cultures whilst reflecting 
        on their own presence in the British Museum. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">There is, of course, 
        nothing typically Japanese about the souvenir. The practice of acquiring 
        objects through which the ephemeral memory of places and events is consumed 
        by travellers is a phenomenon shared by many world cultures. However, 
        a distinctive element of domestic tourism in Japan is the importance of 
        the relationship between the traveller and those who remain at home - 
        a relationship negotiated through such gifts as food, trinkets or crafted 
        objects. For the gift to be a souvenir, it also has to be recognised as 
        conveying the particularity of a place as well as the traveller's experience 
        of it. Authenticity is not only what the traveller may look for in choosing 
        a souvenir but is also an active part of how communities project themselves 
        towards others. In the context of domestic tourism, visitors are thus 
        outsiders within their own country, and the host community aims to provide 
        a distinctive and memorable experience of the visit. One of the most striking 
        elements of travel within Japan is the highly developed services including 
        a particularly complex market of souvenirs. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The exhibition will 
        explore these issues through four interconnected themes. An examination 
        of goods on sale for visitors to temples and shrines across Japan illustrates 
        the continuing role of ritual and the importance of pilgrimages in the 
        history with, for example, 'the three famous views' of Matsushima, Miyajima 
        and Amanohashidate. Finally, it is suggested that souvenirs are not just 
        a chosen encapsulation of the memory of place within an object. As gifts, 
        they are also reminders of relationships between different people and 
        between people and communities. It is in these terms that they are described 
        in the exhibition by many Japanese as they comment on favourite souvenirs 
        on display in their homes. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Visitors will be able 
        to take away their own souvenir of the exhibition in the form of a specially 
        created stamp, similar to those found at Japan's major tourist attractions, 
        which is applied to the gallery guide. Or via an authentic, shocking pink, 
        Japanese photo booth which produces a sheet of photo stickers as a permanent 
        reminder of the exhibition. </font></p>
