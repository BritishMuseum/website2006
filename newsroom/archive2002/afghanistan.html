        exhibition traces the development of our understanding of the history 
        of Afghanistan through an early 19th-century collection of its antiquities. 
        The deliberate destruction of the gigantic, rock-cut Buddha statues of 
        Bamiyan in 2001 brought the loss of Afghanistan's rich pre-Islamic cultural 
        heritage to world attention, and has rendered the surviving records and 
        relics of that past all the more important. The British Museum is fortunate 
        to have a comprehensive array of archaeological finds collected by Charles 
        Masson (1800-53), the first explorer and recorder of ancient sites in 
        the neighbourhood of Kabul and Jalalabad. The artefacts range in date 
        from the Greek through to the Islamic period (3rd century BC - 16th century 
        AD). They include important relic deposits excavated from Buddhist stupas 
        in the region, as well as some 7,000 coins and a quantity of rings, seals 
        and other small objects, principally from the urban site of Begram to 
        the north of Kabul. Begram ( ancient Alexandria of Caucasus, the city 
        founded by Alexander the Great ) now lies buried beneath Baghram, the 
        military air base so much in the news during the recent conflict. The 
        coins collected and recorded by Masson provide unique and comprehensive 
        numismatic evidence for reconstructing the history of this lost city, 
        as only a very small area of the site was ever excavated.</font></p>
      <p> <font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> </font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Charles 
        Masson (alias James Lewis) was dismissed by many of his contemporaries 
        as a deserter (albeit pardoned), adventurer, spy and writer of bad verse. 
        He was also unforgivably proved correct in his criticism of the British 
        East India Company's policies that led to the disastrous First Anglo-Afghan 
        War (1838-42). As a result, the archaeological value of his work in Afghanistan 
        (1833-38) has been largely ignored ever since. This exhibition will mark 
        the culmination of the Masson Project, which, since 1993, has sought to 
        redress this oversight by studying his comprehensive manuscript records 
        in the British Library in conjunction with his rich collection of finds 
        now in the British Museum. It will reconstruct the archaeological record 
        of some of the sites, based on Masson's written accounts of his excavations, 
        his original drawings and maps in the India Office archives of the British 
        Library, and photographs from 20th-century surveys of the sites. It will 
        also display a wide range of his discoveries, including such spectacular 
        finds as the gold Bimaran casket, a key item for dating the first appearance 
        of the Buddha image in the art of this region.</font><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>
