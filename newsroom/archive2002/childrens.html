        life with children's COMPASS</b></font><br>
        <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Made possible by Ford 
        Motor Company Fund<br>
        <strong><a href="childrenscompass" target="_blank"><b>www.thebritishmuseum.ac.uk/childrenscompass</b></a></strong></font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Following the success 
        of The British Museum's collections website COMPASS, a parallel site has 
        been developed specifically for children, introduced by Alfred the British 
        Museum lion. <b>children's COMPASS</b> has been developed by curators, 
        teachers and education officers and is aimed at 7-11 year olds and their 
        teachers. The website has been fully evaluated, with input coming from 
        over 100 children and staff from local Camden primary schools.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>children's COMPASS</b> 
        contains information on over 800 key objects in the Museum's collections, 
        linked to both printable and online activities. Children will be able 
        to solve the hieroglyphs' spell and open the mummy's tomb, try to piece 
        together the Sutton Hoo helmet, or design their own mythical creature. 
        There are also online Tours on subjects of general interest such as Animal 
        Mummies, others based on the National Curriculum, and some written by 
        the children themselves.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Children are also 
        encouraged to contribute to the site in other ways. There is a monthly 
        competition, with the prize winners' work displayed on the Home page, 
        and Noticeboards show off children's artwork and writing. With the 'Ask 
        the Expert' facility, children can email their questions to curators, 
        and a selection of answers are displayed each month.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Some Tours are specially 
        written for younger children, others for families. For teachers there 
        are adaptable classroom resources with teaching suggestions explaining 
        how to alter them for children with special needs, including extension 
        activities. Like the main site, children's COMPASS has been written with 
        accessibility in mind, with a text only version of the site in production 
        for those using screen readers. </font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#000000"><br wp="BR2">

          <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Ford's support of children's 
          COMPASS is part of a larger initiative by the company to forge long-term 
          partnerships with leading cultural institutions, such as The British 
          Museum. Ford's longstanding commitment to supporting innovative educational 
          initiative has resulted in the development of numerous programs and 
          facilities at cultural institutions throughout the world. In addition 
          to <strong>children's COMPASS</strong> and the Ford Centre for Young 
          Visitors at The British Museum, Ford has sponsored Ford Free Days at 
          museums across the United States and the Ford Learning Center at the 
          Nelson-Atkins Museum in Kansas City. Ford has also partnered with the 
          Henry Ford Museum &amp; Greenfield Village to establish the Henry Ford 
          Academy. The academy serves a diverse student body that learns and studies 
          in a setting dedicated to invention and innovation. Other programs supported 
          by Ford, such as the African American Reference Collection Project in 
          New Orleans ensure that all aspects of American culture are preserved 
          and accessible to future generations. Additionally, Ford's sponsorship 
          of nationally touring exhibitions always features educational components 
          that draw together the museum and the classroom. For more information
