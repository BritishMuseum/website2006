        Glory: The medallic art of 16th century Italy</b><br>
        13 June - 22 September 2002<br>
        Room 90<br>

      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The British Museum's 
        collection of late Renaissance medals is one of the finest in the world 
        and yet an exhibition has never before been devoted to these intriguing 
        objects. This exhibition, which includes works by such celebrated artists 
        as the goldsmith Benvenuto Cellini and the sculptor Leone Leoni, examines 
        the development of the art form during this crucial period in its history, 
        and looks at how artists set about making medals, the messages they communicated 
        and how the medals themselves were used by the people who commissioned 
        them. A final section is devoted to the appeal that these works of art 
        have exerted on British collectors over the centuries, from the antiquarians 
        and Grand Tourists of the 17th and 18th centuries, to art lovers of more 
        recent times. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The medal, first created 
        in the princely courts of Renaissance Italy, was the 16th century transformed 
        into a recognisably modern form. Developed in the 1430s as a means of 
        conveying personal statements about princes and members of their courts, 
        by 1600 it was being mass produced as an instrument of state propaganda. 
        Central to this development was the introduction of the striking process. 
        Whereas earlier medals had been produced by casting, many 16th century 
        medals were made by the increasingly sophisticated technique of striking. 
        Cellini, one of the first artists to use the screw-press, produced delicately 
        worked struck medals for Pope Clement VII, two of which are featured in 
        the exhibition. At the same time the continuation of the casting tradition 
        is exemplified by the large cast works of such artists as Leone Leoni 
        and Jacopo da Trezzo. Jacopo's exquisitely chased cast gold medal of Mary 
        Tudor, made during a visit the artist made to London in 1554, is one of 
        the highlights of the show. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Some of the medals 
        in the exhibition were made to highlight the virtues claimed by the individuals 
        portrayed on them. Others commemorated events, ranging from the building 
        of the Uffizi in Florence to the Spanish conquest of America and the St 
        Bartholomew's Day massacre in France. This last medal, produced in Rome 
        and showing Pope Gregory XIII on one side and on the other a sword-wielding 
        angel advancing of the bodies of the slain, was to fascinate and appal 
        British collectors in equal measure. </font></p>
