      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Vietnam Behind 
        the Lines: Images from the War 1965-75</b><br>
        13 June - 1 December 2002<br>
        Room 91<br>
        Admission free </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Television footage 
        and reportage photography transmitted the American-Vietnam war from the 
        remote jungles of southeast Asia direct to the living rooms of ordinary 
        people in the West. For the first time in history, a major civilian audience 
        was able in total safety to monitor military operations, as they happened, 
        in battle zones on the other side of the world. Tremendous numbers of 
        people lost their lives in the conflict and the effects of this war will 
        continue to be felt for decades to come. Correspondents, journalists, 
        photographers and artists travelled to the battle scenes and their work 
        largely dictated popular understanding of the war. Indeed, certain images 
        from this conflict ultimately contributed to the cessation of the American-Vietnam 
        war in 1975.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The purpose of this 
        exhibition is to present an unfamiliar aspect of this period. Most of 
        the images we associate with the war come from Western film and documentary 
        makers, journalists and artists but the 132 exhibits included in this 
        show are all works by the North Vietnamese themselves. Some of these artists 
        were engaged in the creation of propaganda materials for the government, 
        some in the recording of the war, others simply exercising a creative 
        talent. The majority were patriots who worked alongside the guerilla army, 
        fighting for their country against a foreign force. Combining traditional 
        and contemporary techniques, they used an extremely diverse range of media 
        including hand-painted posters, paintings on rice paper, watercolours, 
        pen and ink sketches, drawings in crayon and chalk, ink paintings, acrylics 
        on cardboard, and printed compositions. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Vietnam Behind the 
        Lines will be thematically arranged in five distinct sections: hand-painted 
        posters and official propaganda; wartime communications and base camp 
        life; combat and the new active role of women; portraits; and depictions 
        of working life behind the lines on the land and in industry. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Vietnam Behind the 
        Lines will be the first exhibition of its kind in Europe introducing a 
        new audience to some of the most arresting and unusual images of the American-Vietnam 
        war. All works were recently purchased by The British Museum, half with 
        the support of The British Museum Friends, with such an exhibition in 
        mind. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The exhibition will 
        be accompanied by a fully-illustrated catalogue <i>Vietnam Behind the 
        Lines - Images from the War 1965-1975</i> by Jessica Harrison-Hall (paperback, 
        £15.99) featuring newly commissioned photography, inscriptions in both 
        original Vietnamese and in translation, interviews with well-known Vietnamese 
        artists commissioned from Vietnam and archival photographs by Vietnamese 
        reporters. </font></p>

        information please call the Press Office on 020 7323 8525. </font></p>
