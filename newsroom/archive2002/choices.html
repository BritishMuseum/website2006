        <font size="2" color="#000066">The British Museum Faces Hard Choices</font></font></b></font></strong></font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The British Museum 
        is developing a package of measures to reduce an impending £5 million 
        deficit in the face of the fall in tourism to London. Museum senior staff 
        are modelling projected cuts of at least 15 per cent to ensure that the 
        finances of one of the world's largest and most important cultural institutions 
        are placed on a firm footing for the future.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Museum currently 
        has a revenue budget of some £45 million. £36 million comes from government 
        grant, a figure that has not increased for a number of years; other income 
        includes sales and sponsorships. There are just over 1000 staff and the 
        salary bill is some £29 million.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"We've been hit hard", 
        underlined Christopher Jones, the Museum's Accounting officer. "It is 
        not just the British Museum's problem; museums and galleries both in the 
        UK and around the world are finding their financial position difficult, 
        with tourism sharply down.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">We obviously need 
        to ensure that we live within our means. The present situation calls for 
        adjustment to provide for long-term sustainability. At this stage no cuts 
        can be ruled out including job losses. We're looking at some painful choices 
        including reducing the number of galleries open and reducing the number 
        of exhibitions we mount. We will, however, be making absolutely sure that 
        all our core values are maintained. We also want the Museum to be in the 
        best possible shape as we enter our 250<sup>th</sup> anniversary year 
        in 2003."</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Museum staff were 
        told at open meetings that plans were being developed for approval by 
        the Board of Trustees by the end of April.</font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#000000"><br wp="BR1">

        to Editors</strong></font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The British Museum, 
        which holds some 8m artefacts in trust for the nation, received 4.6m visitors 
        last year, 45% of whom are from the UK and 17% from the USA.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The British Museum 
        has doubled income per head since the opening of the Great Court through 
        increased retail, catering and other services.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Opening hours of the 
        Great Court were reduced with the agreement of the Millennium Commission 
        on 2 January 2002 to reflect the pattern of evening visitors. The Great 
        Court now opens everyday at 9am and closes at 6pm on Sunday-Wednesday 
        and 11pm on Thursday-Saturday.</font></p>

        Mr Christopher Jones was appointed Accounting Officer by the DCMS upon 
        the departure of Managing Director, Suzanna Taverne, on 31 December 2001. 
        Mr Neil MacGregor, currently Director of the National Gallery, has been 
        appointed as Director and will take up his post at 1 August 2002.</font></p>
