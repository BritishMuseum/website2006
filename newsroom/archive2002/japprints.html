      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Japanese Prints 
        during the Allied Occupation 1945-1952</b><br>
        4 September - 1 December 2002<br>

      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In 1945 much of urban 
        Japan lay in ruins, the land occupied by foreign powers for the first 
        time in the country’s history. To many Japanese it seemed that everything 
        had been lost, but in fact the nation would quickly demonstrate - and 
        on a much larger scale than ever before - its ability to recover physically, 
        economically and culturally from apparent disaster. With the realisation 
        that the Occupation Forces were not oni (‘demons’) but largely benevolent 
        and genial individuals, the concept of a ‘New Japan’ was quickly promulgated. 
        It was one which had attractions to people who had lived in many cases 
        all their lives under a totalitarian regime. All the visual arts began 
        to benefit almost from the outset, and the years between 1945 and 1952 
        demonstrated increasing confidence and considerable achievement in painting, 
        calligraphy, prints, ceramics and other media. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">This illuminating 
        exhibition examines in detail how one school of printmakers, under the 
        pioneering leadership of Onchi Koshiro (1891-1955), managed to survive 
        the Pacific War and as artists found themselves among those calling for 
        a new search for the nation’s heart in its aesthetic traditions. Although 
        many continued to suffer from the privations of the war years, they also 
        received unexpected appreciation and support from artists and administrators 
        among the Allied occupying forces.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Symbolic of this process 
        was the meeting of the American graphic artist Ernst Hacker (1917-87), 
        posted to Tokyo in Spring 1946, with Onchi and his circle and Munakata 
        Shiko (1903-75), who was then almost unknown. On meeting Onchi, Hacker’s 
        own print style rapidly changed from the monochrome and representational 
        to the richly coloured and abstract idiom which Onchi had been developing. 
        By 1952, when the Allied Occupation ended, Onchi and his circle and Munakata 
        were being eagerly collected in the United States and these two, introduced 
        to the world by their American admirers, are now recognised as Japan’s 
        greatest print artists of the 20th century. Prints, photographs and other 
        archival material acquired by Ernst Hacker during the post-war years and 
        recently given to the Museum by his widow form the basis of this revealing 
        exhibition.</font></p>
