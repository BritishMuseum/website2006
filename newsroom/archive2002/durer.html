        Dürer and His Legacy: The Graphic Work of a Renaissance Artist<br>
        </b>Sponsored by Wilmer, Cutler & Pickering <b> <br>
        </b>Room 5</font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><br>
        5 December 2002 - 23 March 2003<br>

      <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Albrecht 
        <span
class=SpellE>Dürer</span> (1471–1528) was in a sense the first truly international 
        artist. He was certainly the first who saw how to exploit the new technologies 
        of printing to ensure that his works were known and sought after not just 
        in his own country but across the whole of Europe, making him the great 
        master of the multiple image and an international celebrity. <span
class=GramE>The AD</span> monogram became a trademark recognised and respected 
        worldwide. His drawings and his prints, on which his reputation was built, 
        are at the heart of this exhibition, the first to be devoted to him in 
        Britain in more than 30 years. </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">As a 
        prelude to the Museum’s 250<sup>th</sup> anniversary year in 2003, the 
        exhibition will celebrate the superlative collection of <span class=SpellE>Dürer</span> 
        prints, drawings and watercolours in The British Museum, many of which 
        were Sir Hans Sloane’s original bequest to the Museum in 1753. In addition, 
        there will be a number of outstanding loans, including the National Gallery’s 
        Saint Jerome, and drawings of prime importance from the <span class=SpellE>Ashmolean 
        </span>Museum, the Royal Collection, <span
class=GramE>the</span> <span class=SpellE>Kupferstichkabinett</span> in Berlin 
        and the <span class=SpellE>Albertina</span> in Vienna. Two superb drawings, 
        the <span
class=SpellE>Albertina’s</span> Self-portrait as a thirteen-year old and the world 
        famous <span class=GramE>Praying</span> Hands, have never before been 
        displayed in this country. The aim of the exhibition is to examine <span
class=SpellE>Dürer’s</span> extraordinary achievements as a draughtsman and printmaker 
        during his own lifetime and to look at how the artist’s widely-disseminated 
        and innovative imagery influenced artists and craftsmen for centuries 
        to come.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The exhibition begins 
        with an examination of the artist’s revolutionary approaches to self-portraiture 
        and looks at the differing ways that other artists have represented and 
        constructed his image over the centuries. The next sections follow the 
        chronology of <span class=SpellE>Dürer’s</span> life, with an emphasis 
        on a particular period or project in each.</font></p>
      <div class=Section3> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">They 
        include his early years in Nuremberg; his first visit to Italy which stimulated 
        him to produce the earliest-known group of <span class=SpellE>watercolour</span> 
        landscapes drawn from nature to have survived in the history of western 
        art; the production of his virtuoso engraving Adam and Eve in 1504 with 
        its numerous related studies; his work for the Emperor Maximilian including 
        the massive Triumphal Arch – one of the largest prints ever produced - 
        and his three enigmatic master prints of 1513-1514, Knight, Death and 
        the Devil, Melancholia and St Jerome in his Study. The following sections 
        show the impact of <span class=SpellE>Dürer’s</span> work on other artists, 
        including Germany, Holland and Italy (Rembrandt among them), and his long-standing 
        influence on ceramic designs from 16<sup>th</sup> century <span class=SpellE>maiolica</span> 
        to 18<sup>th</sup> century Meissen. <span class=GramE>A focus on the late 
        16<sup>th</sup> and early 17<sup>th</sup> century phenomenon known as 
        the ‘<span class=SpellE>Dürer</span> Renaissance’, largely created by 
        the scarcity of the master’s work, shows how glossy pastiches and elegant 
        copies of his work became so highly sought after that artists such as 
        Hans Hoffmann became well-known primarily for their skill at producing 
        them.</span></font> 
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The exhibition concludes 
          with <span class=SpellE>Dürer’s</span> legacy in the 19th century, particularly 
          the way in which his work was interpreted by Romantic artists such as 
          <span class=SpellE>Caspar</span> David Friedrich. Amid the rise of German 
          nationalism, <span
class=SpellE>Dürer’s</span> name and art began to achieve a virtually iconic status 
          and a final section looks at how the artist became an object of almost 
          religious veneration in the elaborate festivals celebrating the anniversaries 
          of his birth and death dates of 1828 and 1871.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The exhibition is 
          accompanied by the fully-illustrated catalogue Albrecht <span
class=SpellE>Dürer</span> and his Legacy (£35.00, British Museum Press, December 
          2002) by <span class=SpellE>Giulia</span> <span class=SpellE>Bartrum</span>,

          with a text by Nobel Prize winning novelist Günter Grass written in
