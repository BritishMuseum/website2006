      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Changing money is 
        one of the most tangible features about crossing a border into a foreign 
        country. It makes us aware that we are no longer at home, that some things 
        really are different abroad. But within most of Western Europe this is 
        an experience that will not be on offer for very much longer. For here, 
        in its birthplace, the age of the national currency seems to be drawing 
        to a close. On 1 January 2002 the Euro will supplant twelve of the world's 
        major currencies in the countries of the Eurozone. By the end of February, 
        the old coins and notes in these countries will no longer be legal tender. 
        These important elements of national difference are soon to disappear 
        from the daily lives of 300 million Western Europeans, maybe forever.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">This new exhibition 
        marks the passing of some of the most important currencies in history, 
        including the French franc, the German deutschmark, the Italian lira and 
        the Dutch guilder. It looks at their life-stories through coins and banknotes, 
        and finds them to be surprisingly brief. For none of the currencies in 
        question is much more than 200 years old. The French franc was introduced 
        in 1794; while the mighty deutschmark is a spritely fifty-something. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Also on display will 
        be the new, international coins and notes of the Euro which millions of 
        Britons will meet and use for the first time on their summer holidays 
        on the Continent.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The central contention 
        of this exhibition is that the national currencies of Europe are modern 
        inventions, like the nations that made them. In this country we like to 
        think our state, and our currency, are somehow different, that they have 
        been around forever, that giving up the pound would somehow mean the end 
        of Britain. But in reality the pound has had a far more complex history 
        than we tend to imagine. For example, the first pound note was not issued 
        until 1797, while the Queen's head on English banknotes, which seems to 
        have become such a point of national pride, dates back no further than 
        1960.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">There are of course 
        hard economic questions to be answered before Britain decides whether 
        or not to join the Euro. What this exhibition reveals is that the phenomenon 
        of national currencies may be nothing more than a passing phase in the 
        fast-moving history of Europe.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">To accompany the exhibition, 
        The British Museum and the Institute of Historical Research have organised 
        a conference, which will be held on Wednesday 5 June 2002 at the University 
        of London. Changing Currencies of Europe will feature contributions from 
        high profile bankers and historians and is also sponsored by Publicis.</font></p>
