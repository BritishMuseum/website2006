      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Queen of Sheba: 
        Treasures from ancient Yemen</b><br>
        Sponsored by Barclays PLC<br>
        9 June - 13 October 2002<br>
        Joseph Hotung Great Court Gallery<br>
        Admission charge </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The myth and mystery 
        of the Queen of Sheba provides an introduction to the magnificent ancient 
        civilisation of Yemen, where she is believed to have originated. The exhibition, 
        sponsored by Barclays PLC, focuses on the importance and splendour of 
        the kingdoms of Southern Arabia that prospered through a lucrative trade 
        in incense and other precious commodities to the Near East and Roman Empire. 
        Spectacular artefacts from the Museum's own collections and on loan from 
        the American Foundation for the Study of Man and museums across Yemen 
        will bring to life the history of a complex civilisation mostly unfamiliar 
        to a Western audience. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The exhibition will 
        begin with an examination of the Queen of Sheba in art, looking at modern, 
        19th century and Renaissance representations. She is variously viewed 
        as a figure of beauty and seduction, the propounder of riddles to King 
        Solomon (the Old Testament), a convert to Islam (the Qur'an), and a precursor 
        of the Magi (Western Christian artistic tradition). The story of the Queen 
        of Sheba is extremely important to the national and religious identity 
        of Ethiopia where she is thought to have introduced Christianity and given 
        birth to Solomon's son and heir, Menelik, the first king of the Ethiopian 
        Solomonic dynasty. This story is transcribed in the<i> Kebra Nagast</i>, 
        on loan from the British Library. Paintings - including a previously unpublished, 
        superbly detailed watercolour by Edward Poynter depicting the arrival 
        of Sheba at the court of Solomon - as well as prints, drawings and film 
        stills will be used to show different interpretations of the Sheba legend. 
        </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The early history 
        and cultural development of Southern Arabia is explored through new archaeological 
        discoveries which illustrate the existence of a rich Bronze Age culture 
        in Yemen. Important inscriptions belonging to the first Millennium BC 
        mark the beginning of the historical period, a bronze statue of a Sabaean 
        warrior and alabaster statues depicting later rulers of the rival kingdom 
        of Aswan, illustrate the early history of the region. Extravagant incense 
        burners and aromatic resins highlight the mainstay of the ancient economy, 
        and the evocative smell of incense will be used to enrich the atmosphere 
        in the gallery. Examples of decorative architectural elements, religious 
        iconography, gold jewellery, pottery, glass and metalwork will reveal 
        aspects of daily life in the area. The development of local arts and crafts 
        with influences from the Persian empire and the classical world will be 
        revealed through artefacts such as the exquisitely crafted miniature gold 
        bull's head, the revered symbol of the Sabaean national deity, Almaqah, 
        which will go on display for the first time. A recently conserved bronze 
        altar with bull's head spouts provides a unique insight into religious 
        practice in the 6th century BC and a lifelike bronze hand with a dedicatory 
        inscription offers a glimpse into popular superstition. Funerary sculptures 
        and grave offerings, including the beautiful alabaster head of a woman 
        nick-named 'Myriam', reveal the different attitudes to death and the afterlife 
        in ancient Yemen. Our understanding of the land of the Queen of Sheba 
        has been greatly increased by recent archaeological discoveries, but the 
        work goes on and Myriam's mysterious smile hints at further, yet to be 
        discovered secrets of ancient South Arabia. </font></p>
