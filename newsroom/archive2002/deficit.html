      to Address Museum Deficit</font></strong></font><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#000000"><br>
      <br>
      </font><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The British Museum 
      has today announced a series of measures designed to achieve a balanced 
      budget and place its finances on a sound footing for the future.</font><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#000000"><br wp="BR1">
      <br wp="BR2">
      </font><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In January the 
      Museum explained that plans for cost reduction were being drawn up to deal 
      with a structural deficit. A systematic exercise in examining the costs 
      of running The British Museum has been carried out over several months. 
      Close attention has been paid to what can be referred to as those "core 
      values" which relate to the collections and their presentation to the public 
      and which must be sustained.</font><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#000000"><br wp="BR1">
      <br wp="BR2">
      </font><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Addressing an 
      impending deficit of £5 million in 2004/05 is a difficult task. Proposals 
      from management were fully discussed by the Board of Trustees on 27<sup>th</sup> 
      April and approved for implementation. The reduction in expenditure will 
      be made as soon as possible in a phased manner for full realisation within 
      two years. It will include a reduction in staff levels (around 150 out of 
      a total of some 1100), which will be carried out by a combination of recruitment 
      restrictions, restructuring, normal staff turnover, voluntary redundancy 
      and - as a last resort - compulsory redundancy. In future the Museum expects 
      to undertake a greater proportion of its programme through the use of project-based 
      staff.</font><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#000000"><br wp="BR2">
      </font> 
      <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Museum opening hours 
        and daily access to galleries will be maintained. Some existing gallery 
        areas will be developed for new types of behind-the-scenes activity. A 
        reconfigured department of Education, Information and Learning Resources, 
        which will incorporate new media, will maintain the Museum's position 
        as a primary resource for schools and lifelong learners.</font></p>
      <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The departments of 
        Conservation and Scientific Research will be brought together to deal 
        with fundamental aspects of preservation and the properties of materials. 
        Project-based staff will be recruited to deal with some specific needs 
        such as the presentation of objects in exhibitions.</font><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#000000"><br wp="BR1">
        <br wp="BR2">
        </font><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The comprehensive 
        review introduces cost-reduction measures in nearly every area of the 
        Museum's activities, including support services such as information systems, 
        operations and marketing. Longer term efficiencies will result from investment 
        in a new control centre and CCTV. Rationalisation of the Museum's estate 
        will include relocation of staff from Burlington Gardens and certain perimeter 
        properties by 2004.</font><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#000000"><br wp="BR1">
        <br wp="BR2">
        </font><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The cost reduction 
        planned has been conducted by the Museum's Accounting officer, Christopher 
        Jones, who said, "Although we have made good progress in improving income 
        generation and efficiency of operations over a number of years, we have 
        - like other museums and galleries - found that this has not been enough 
        to deal with the increased costs of greater public access, the downturn 
        in the London Tourist market, and particularly the challenges of a government 
        grant which has reduced in real value.</font><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#000000"><br wp="BR1">
        <br wp="BR2">
        </font><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"We greatly 
        regret the inevitable effects of the cost reduction on our staff, who 
        are being fully briefed. The details of job losses in specific areas will 
        now be subject to formal consultation with staff and the Trade Unions. 
        We shall work hard to ensure that the impacts of decisions are fully considered 
        and that - under the new Director, Neil MacGregor - the Museum can enter 
        its 250<sup>th</sup> anniversary year in 2003 with confidence.</font><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#000000"><br wp="BR1">
        <br wp="BR2">
        </font><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"We are determined 
        that our 5 million visitors can continue to enjoy inspiring and educational 
        visits," added Mr Jones. "New galleries will become available next year, 
        temporary exhibitions remain lively and intriguing, access beyond our 
        walls will increase through the internet, and loans to museums elsewhere 
        in the UK will reach higher levels than before. In all these ways, The 
        British Museum will continue to advance its position as a source of authority 
        concerning the ancient and modern world."</font></p>
