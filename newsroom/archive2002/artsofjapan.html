        A Selection from the Permanent Collections</b><br>

      <font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">This exhibition presents 
      a selection of Japanese arts dating from 1000 BC to the 20<sup>th</sup> 
      century and is a celebration of recently conserved artefacts and works of 
      art which have not yet been seen in their restored states. There are displays 
      of archaeological material, ceramics, Buddhist and secular sculpture, lacquerware, 
      paintings, woodblocks and the arts associated with chivalry. In the Konica 
      Gallery there is a display of Ukiyo-e prints and illustrated books which 
      focuses on the period 1800 -1820 and includes works by Utamaro, Toyokuni 
      and Hokusai.</font> 
      <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">From the <em>Nara</em> 
        period (AD 719 - 794), arms and armour were given special attention. This 
        tradition carried on well into the nineteenth century. The art of the 
        Japanese sword is represented in the exhibition by a number of blades 
        and mountings, which are traditionally displayed separately. These have 
        recently been polished and conserved in Japan through the generosity of 
        the <strong>Peter Moores Foundation</strong>. The Japanese sword is made 
        is made of steel folded many times to create a strong laminate. Painstaking 
        polishing by specialist artisans have revealed the folding grain of the 
        steel, the textures of the surface and the crystalline structure of the 
        blade's hardened edge.</font> </p>
      <font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">During the past few years 
      many of the Japanese Department's grandest paintings have undergone extensive 
      repair in the Hirayama Studio for the Conservation of Eastern Pictorial 
      Art at The British Museum. Some of these were acquired in such poor conditions 
      that they could not be publicly displayed. These include the screens depicting 
      horses, in the chivalry section of the exhibition, and the giant fan, in 
      the painting section. The giant fan, one of the largest folding fans ever 
      made, was completed in 1893 and has ribs of over two metres long.<br wp="BR2">
      </font> 
      <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Paintings from the 
        later Edo period (1600 - 1868) and Meiji era (1868 - 1912) also feature 
        strongly in the exhibition. During the Edo period artists took inspiration 
        from the traditional schools of China of Japan, while others sought stimulus 
        in contemporary Chinese and even European art.</font></p>
      <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The works by Utamaro 
        and Toyokuni relate to the illustrated book <em>Ehon Taik-ki</em>, a fictional 
        life of the dictator Hideyoshi (16<sup>th</sup> century). These were originally 
        suppressed and still bear censorship seals which modern scholars have 
        used to identify them. Hokusai, famous for his 36 Views of Mount Fuji, 
        experimented with a Western influenced manner of depicting spatial recession. 
        The depictions of landscapes in the exhibition are some examples of this 
        experimentation. Hokusai was also prolific in the genre of highly dramatic 
        illustrations for popular fiction, typically Japanese illustrations of 
        Chinese adventure stories, examples of which also appear in the exhibition.
