      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">John Sell Cotman's 
        <em>Greta Bridge</em> has been called one of the greatest creations of 
        the Romantic movement and the most perfect image in the entire history 
        of English watercolour painting. It forms the centrepiece of this exhibition 
        of Cotman's work, the first devoted to the artist for twenty years. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><em>Greta Bridge</em> 
        is based on drawings Cotman made in North Yorkshire in the late summer 
        of 1805. The Museum is particularly rich in watercolours and drawings 
        from this crucial phase of Cotman's career, and the exhibition includes 
        other studies of the river, and the surrounding woodland. Some of his 
        time was spent at nearby Rokeby Park, soon to be immortalised by Walter 
        Scott, who described its surroundings as 'wild and romantic' in the introduction 
        to his poem of 1813. Cotman's excursion to Durham Cathedral is represented 
        in the exhibition by two further watercolours, which show the artist applying 
        his clear, analytical method to architectural subjects.</font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#000000">

        <br wp="BR2">
        </font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">During his middle 
        years, Cotman lived in relative isolation in Norwich and Yarmouth. Works 
        such as <em>The dismasted brig</em> and <em>Mousehold Heath</em> show 
        his completely original sensitivity to varying qualities of colour and 
        space both on the coast and inland. Cotman's two volumes of prints of 
        Normandy architecture, on which he worked from 1817 until 1822, reveal 
        his genius for discovering the underlying structure of a view or a building. 
        After so much exacting linear draughtsmanship, his final period is characterised 
        by brilliant colour, and a much more expressive use of paint. These paintings 
        and drawings are freer, concerned to capture the elemental power of wind 
        and weather. A series of drawings made on a final trip to Norfolk in the 
        autumn of 1841, when he found much of the familiar landscape transformed 
        by floods, provides a moving conclusion to his lifelong meditation on 
        the place of man in nature.<br wp="BR1">

        </font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">As a complement 
        to the 40 works by Cotman, the exhibition includes watercolours and drawings 
        by inspirational figures such as Girtin and Gainsborough, and contemporaries 
        Peter Dewint and John Crome, which cast light on the development of Cotman's 
        own art. The exhibition also marks the centenary of the acquisition of 
        the collection of James Reeve, the Norwich curator and collector who in 
        1902 sold <em>Greta Bridge</em> to the British Museum with well over one 
        thousand works by artists of the Norwich School.</font></p>
