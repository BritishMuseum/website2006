            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFCCFF">The 
              themes illustrated in the floats paraded in the Nebuta Festival 
              are taken from historical, religious and folk tales, but also contain 
              visual puns referring to current events. The <i>nebuta</i> made 
              by Takashi Kitamura for The British Museum in 2001 is entitled ‘Minamoto 
              no Yoshitsune crossing the Tsugaru Straits'. Minamoto no Yoshitsune 
              was a 12th century warrior whose popularity and success as a military 
              leader posed a threat to his brother, Minamoto no Yoritomo, who 
              had him killed. He became the tragic hero of many tales, including 
              one in which he survives and flees Japan over the seas with the 
              help of his powerful horse. This is the scene depicted on the<i> 
              nebuta</i> and parallels the voyage of the Nebuta Team crossing 
              the seas to the UK to construct the festival float in The British 
              Museum. The painting illustrates the theme and the design which 
              Kitamura will follow in the construction of the float at The British 
              Museum. Such paintings form the visual basis from which the artists 
              elaborate the three-dimensional giant form of the <i>nebuta </i>itself. 
              They also announce the artistic programme for the festival in Aomori 
              each year.<br>

            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFCCFF">Before 
              the Wellcome Trust Gallery opened to the public at 9am, the last 
              of the materials and equipment was carried through to the exhibition 
              space and construction of the <i>nebuta</i> began. The first step 
              consisted in building a wooden grid to which the wooden inner structure 
              of the <i>nebuta </i>will be fixed. Measuring 7000mm x 5600mm, it 
              took most of the morning to make with Takashi and Akira Kitamura 
              and Maximilian Marshall working together to cut, place and secure 
              the pieces of wood while Maki Fujiwara assisted in organising the 
              work space. The grid was made by lunchtime and the steel girders 
              placed underneath it in preparation for lifting the completed <i>nebuta</i> 
              on 16 December. </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFCCFF">Some 
              details of the wire structure of the <i>nebuta</i> were made in 
              advance in Japan and shipped to the UK in time for the start of 
              the exhibition. Heads and hands in particular require more time 
              to create: lying on the floor around the grid, one can also make 
              out the shapes of the horse's hoofs, lotus buds and splashes of 
              water. </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFCCFF">After 
              lunch, Takashi Kitamura focused on the head of the warrior Minamoto 
              no Yoshitsune: the wire part making the head was made to stand by 
              inserting and fixing a number of wooden batons. Once stable, the 
              head was positioned on the floor at the front of the display area 
              so that the artists could work on it. Takashi Kitamura attached 
              the helmet to the top of the head while Akira Kitamura and Maximilian 
              Marshall then outlined and shaped the back of the helmet. Once the 
              wire frame of the head was finished, complete with its helmet, the 
              inner wooden structure which helped stabilise it was taken out and 
              one simple long piece of wood inserted so that it could be raised 
              and positioned on the float itself. </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFCCFF">All 
              three men wear a tool belt round their waist from which hammer, 
              screws and staples are extracted as needed. The wire itself is attached 
              by means of cotton thread that is wound round the wire and held 
              in place with PVA glue. Strands of cotton thread ready cut to size 
              and the small lidded box containing the glue are attached to the 
              belt. </font></p>

            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFCCFF">The 
              head that had been raised yesterday was still standing but the structure 
              on which it rested needed strengthening so that it could also sustain 
              the weight of the arms and body of the warrior represented. Before 
              the right arm was raised, a long sword was attached to the hand: 
              the wire form had been made in advance, and now a long wooden plank 
              was inserted. This will serve to strengthen it, but also provide 
              the inner structure to which the lights will be attached.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFCCFF">Positioning 
              of the hand and the angle of the sword was determined by Takashi 
              Kitamura as he stepped back, looked at his preparatory sketch and 
              directed other members of the team. He explained how the size of 
              the head is what will determine the proportions of other details 
              of the float: the height of the body and the width of the shoulders 
              in particular. He also stressed that the figure would not have a 
              separated neck, both for practical reasons and to emphasise its 
              fierce look. As the day progressed, the body was shaped with long 
              pieces of wire extending down from the neck area to the grid base 
              and then with further lengths of wire placed horizontally to create 
              shoulders and chest. </font></p>

            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFCCFF">The 
              other arm went up today and the team increasingly needs to be able 
              to work at height. Until now, much of the work to fix the wire parts 
              and extend the wire cover could be made by climbing inside the wooden 
              structure itself. Now, parts of the armour of Minamoto no Yoshitsune 
              required access from the outside of the structure. Scaffolding companies 
              came and went and it gradually emerged that the flexibility of movement 
              required could only be achieved by means of ladders and boards strategically 
              placed. </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFCCFF">Now 
              that the basic form of body, head and arms was in place, the work 
              concentrated on positioning the parts, strengthening the attachements 
              where they were joined together and finalising the wire form. Soon, 
              the warrior also had its two legs, the right one bent at the knee 
              with the left leg extended to the side. Visitors were now beginning 
              to make out the shape, guessing at the fierce pose of the warrior 
              frozen in mid-air with his sword extended.</font></p>

              the team: a Canadian cabin builder and a British architectural engineer 
              had already come up to observe and point out how 'Japanese saws 
              cut on the pull' and not when the blade is pushed down as with saws 
              available in Europe and north America.</font></p>

              work is concentrated and the team has settled into silent, efficient 
              and rapid cooperation. Hardly a word passes between the three artists 
              as they work together on the <i>nebuta</i>.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFCCFF">Most 
              of the day was spent strengthening the structure of the warrior 
              and taking out excess wood that until then was helping hold up some 
              of the parts. Also removed were those screws that held the figure 
              attached to the wooden grid base. Once seen to be complete with 
              details of the armour attached to the shoulders and the waist, the 
              entire structure was then moved on the grid. Takashi Kitamura stood 
              back and lead the operation, directing turning the figure clockwise 
              so that its face would have a stronger impact on visitors facing 
              the <i>nebuta</i> and moving it closer to the centre so that it 
              can be seen to emerge from the seas and closer to the horse which 
              were yet to come.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFCCFF">In 
              the late afternoon, Mr and Mrs Funahashi arrived. They are the members 
              of the Nebuta Team in charge of electrical matters and their work 
              will consist in placing and installing the light-bulbs and circuits. 
              Having landed in London that afternoon, they came to the Museum 
              to see the exhibition space and assess progress of the work.</font></p>

              Kitamura and Maximilian Marshall worked on the hilt of the sword 
              to strengthen it while Takashi Kitamura picked up the horse's head 
              and thought about its placement. Unlike the head of the warrior 
              which was first worked at floor level, the wooden structure inserted 
              in the horse's head was immediately used to raise it. Its positioning 
              also took longer than for the warrior's head, Takashi Kitamura ensuring 
              that the dynamic slant would suggest a horse emerging from the waves.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFCCFF">After 
              lunch, all three concentrated on making the horse's wings and this 
              seemed to attract far more attention from visitors than other stages 
              had so far. They worked on the floor near the front of the barriers: 
              first an outline was made of wire, this was then chalked onto the 
              floor to ensure the second wing would be similar in size and shape 
              to the first. The outline of wire is then filled with two cross-pieces 
              of wire, still laid flat on the floor. The three-dimensional form 
              gradually emerges as further lengths of wire are shaped and tied 
              to the basic wire structure thus created. </font></p>

              is the day the electrical wiring begins. Bundles of light sockets 
              are brought to the exhibition space, each socket ready prepared 
              with a piece of wire wound round the head to attach it to the <i>nebuta</i>'s 
              structure and short lengths of cable dangling down. Mr Funahashi 
              spends long moments looking at the wire forms to assess the placement 
              of the light bulbs. Work started on the figure's left hand, moving 
              up the arm from the fingers.</font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#FFCCFF">Meanwhile, 
              Takashi and Akira Kitamura and Maximilian Marshall are concentrating 
              on the horse. The angle of the head needs adjusting and the neck 
              and part of the back is still to be formed with wire. As with the 
              human figure, the wooden structure is created first, in this case 
              towering up the length of the horse's neck. Then the horse's front 
              legs were attached, long pieces of wood extending as far as the 
              hoof where the leg is straight, and a more elaborate wooden structure 
              creating the bend in the right leg. From the head, lengths of wire 
              are extended vertically while circles of wire of increasing size 
              are attached to them to gradually form the neck. Finally, the two 
              wings that were made yesterday were raised. Over three metres long, 
              everyone joined in to hold them up while Takashi Kitamura decided 
              on their angle.</font></p>

              Waiting to find out how many were available in stock, Mr Kitamura 
              spent time looking at the tools and materials comparing them with 
              what is available in Japan. Tape measures with inches and feet marked 
              on it were one of the more curious items, possible souvenirs from 
              their trip to the UK.</font></p>

              fashion, with frothy extensions made in advance gradually attached 
              to the tips. Two waves were made today, each then stood on end, 
              positioned and fixed in place. </font></p>
