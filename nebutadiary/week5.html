            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#CCFFFF">Today, 
              Akira Kitamura has started air-brushing and begins with the horse's 
              mottled grey coat. He is in charge of this aspect of the painting 
              on all the larger parts of the <i>nebuta</i>, the horse's coat and 
              the water. As always, the lead artist (in this case his twin brother, 
              Takashi Kitamura) will be painting the face on the front. But before 
              any air-brushing can take place, all the nearby areas have to be 
              protected. Sheets of newspaper are laid over the lower parts of 
              the structure below where the air-brushing will take place. Other 
              sheets are cut to size around details that need protecting, such 
              as the horse trappings that have been painted red, or the eyes and 
              nostrils of the horse. Once this is in place, and Akira Kitamura 
              having achieved the right balance of colours in the paint for the 
              air-brush, he sets to work putting a first thin layer and assessing 
              the overall effect before continuing. This is applied with the lights 
              off on the inside of the <i>nebuta</i>, but he explained that the 
              aim is to achieve a balance with the layers of air-brushed paint, 
              such that whether lit or not from the inside, the colour would look 
              approximately the same. Meanwhile, now that the back scene is entirely 
              covered in paper, Takashi Kitamura begins to outline the ink and 
              charcoal lines on the Kannon figure. Particular concentration goes 
              on the face and the eyes which he carries out by eye. For his choice 
              of patterns on the robes and the crown, Takashi Kitamura refers 
              to a book on the Buddhist iconography of Kannon.</font></p>

            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#CCFFFF">Once 
              the <i>nebuta</i> is complete, it will be lifted onto a platform 
              on Sunday. The platform has to be sturdy enough to carry the weight 
              of the float (over a ton) and yet light enough to be carried and 
              slipped into place once the <i>nebuta</i> is lifted off the floor. 
              Four equal sections were planned and the pieces of wood were brought 
              into the gallery today for assembling to begin. This is also the 
              last day of wax work. Maximilian Marshall is put to work on the 
              horse's hooves. These have been loosely painted with strokes of 
              black ink, creating the lines of the horn and given an added shine 
              for when the float is lit through the application of wax over the 
              ink. Meanwhile, throughout the morning Tomoko Kitamura was working 
              on the intricate patterns of the Kannon figure. She is one of the 
              most proficient wax painters and carries out the more delicate work. 
              By the afternoon, she is joined by most of the other women to paint 
              the details of the clothing. Only the skin of the Kannon figure 
              is left white as Takashi Kitamura will be adding the colour there 
              with the air-brush. In the early afternoon, he completes the face 
              of Minamoto no Yoshitsune. With the careful application of air-brush, 
              Yoshitsune acquires a rugged skin with a healthy pink glow and a 
              shadow of a beard on his cheeks and chin. Although there is still 
              one day to go to finish the <i>nebuta</i> form before it is lifted 
              onto its platform, once Takashi Kitamura finished Yoshitsune's face, 
              there was an overall sense of completion and of drawing to a close. 
              Most of the scaffold boards were withdrawn and the stepladders stacked 
              to one side. The wave and foam which emerges below Yoshitsune's 
              extended arm holding the sword had been created separately and was 
              now brought right up against the figure. Finally, at the end of 
              the day, the entire team and volunteers lifted the back scene to 
              bring it together with the figures of Yoshitsune and the horse and 
              fix it to the main base of the float. Where gaps were left, paper 
              was stuck on and the left-over bowls of colour called upon to patch 
              the design. </font></p>

            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#CCFFFF">The 
              remaining two sections of the platform were assembled today, and 
              all four are now aligned in front of the <i>nebuta</i> in preparation 
              for being slipped under it tomorrow. As the <i>nebuta</i> was visibly 
              nearing completion, more and more visitors were enquiring about 
              the lifting: how would such a fragile, yet heavy structure, weighing 
              between a ton and a ton and a half, be lifted onto a platform? Day 
              32 and this is the last opportunity to work on the sculptural form 
              of the <i>nebuta</i>. In the morning, details of the clothing of 
              the Kannon were protected with newspaper to allow for the air-brushing 
              of the bare skin of the figure. The delicate pink that was to achieved 
              required several layers, to the point that the paper itself began 
              to wrinkle under the spray (though it did straight out as it dried!). 
              Akira Kitamura worked on the waves, applying with the air-brush 
              the different shades of blue that will hint at the depth of the 
              sea and size of the waves. The afternoon was spent putting the final 
              touches to the front of Minamoto no Yoshitsune's costume. The breast-plate 
              of his armour was decorated with fine details in a dark blue, using 
              stencil patterns and requiring a whole team of people around Akira 
              Kitamura while he used the air-brush: two people to help hold the 
              stencils and place them in perfect geometry to each other as they 
              were moved across the paper surface; one person to hold a lamp to 
              improve the lighting conditions under the shadow of the head looming 
              above; one person to ensure the flex of the air-brush did not get 
              tangled; two people to continue mixing the colours and replenish 
              the air-brush whenever Akira Kitamura paused in his work. Finally, 
              he added touches of red with a paint-brush to highlight some of 
              the details in the pattern. Takashi Kitamura stood back from the 
              float to assess the overall completed float: at 3pm today, the <i>nebuta</i> 
              was finished at last. It was an emotional moment for the team and 
              volunteers... </font></p>

            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#CCFFFF">This 
              was the one day in which any problem could have meant the destruction 
              of the four weeks of work carried out until now: the <i>nebuta</i> 
              had to be lifted into the air and its platform slid into place under 
              it. Organising the lifting of the <i>nebuta</i> on museum premises 
              had been one of the most challenging aspects of the project during 
              the exhibition preparations and was put in the hands of the Unusual 
              Rigging Company. Having closely consulted with Takashi Kitamura 
              during the planning stage, the aim was to send a team of two or 
              three men to build a goal-post shaped gantry on either side of the 
              float and hoist it up by means of chains. This was at odds with 
              the way the lifting is done in Japan where some 50 men simply count 
              to three and lift it up onto a wheeled platform. The equipment arrived 
              at 7am and by 9.30am it was erected and ready for the lifting to 
              begin. Chains descended from the gantry and were attached to steel 
              spigots inserted into the hollow beams that had been in place under 
              the base of the <i>nebuta</i> since the beginning of the construction. 
              Six chains on either side were being cranked up slowly and evenly. 
              The entire Nebuta Team, museum staff in readiness to help insert 
              the platform sections, and visitors passing by all watched anxiously 
              as the <i>nebuta</i> creaked, sagged and swayed a little as it finally 
              got off the ground. It took some 45 minutes for it to reach the 
              agreed height of 1m35, but the sag in the middle of the float meant 
              that there were only 4 to 5cm to spare for inserting the platform 
              sections. By 1pm, each of the four sections was in place and straightened 
              and the <i>nebuta</i> lowered back down to rest finally on the completed 
              platform. A sigh of relief! In the afternoon and once the lifting 
              equipment was out of the way, the platform was decorated by the 
              Nebuta Team. First a blue cloth was stapled around the base of the 
              float, continuing the motif of the sea and hiding the joins between 
              the float and the platform. The 'sponsor box' was fixed to the front, 
              advertising as it does in Japan the names of the main partners in 
              the project. Similarly on the small lanterns that are hung all around 
              the two sides and the back of the platform: each of the lanterns 
              carries the name of a sponsor, in this case with both their Japanese 
              and English names. Boards decorated with the traditional motif of 
              a botan, the flower of a tree peony, were finally attached on all 
              sides. Soon, clearing and tidying the area began and surplus materials 
              and equipment were carried away from the gallery. Katsutoshi and 
              Michiko Funahashi were the last to finish: each of the 120 small 
              lanterns had to be installed with its own individual light-bulb...

              was a short morning of work: the Funahashi carried out the final 
              checks on the electrical wiring of the <i>nebuta</i>; Maki Fujiwara, 
              Tokuko Iwasaki, Miyuki Oda and Keiko Osanai finished clearing and 
              cleaning the area which had been used for construction during the 
              last four weeks. Meanwhile in the storage areas backstage, the two 
              husband and wife teams were sorting out tools and equipment ready 
              for shipment back to Japan. The completed <i>nebuta</i> is now on 
              display in the gallery with all lights turned off, except when they 
              are being tested. It is near impossible to guess at the complexity 
              of the internal structure of the float, but if one looks carefully, 
              there are just two places where one can see inside, in the central 
              area of the float at the base of the wave and the back of the horse. 
              Here, the paper does not entirely cover the wire and a few light-bulbs, 
              as well as some of the wood and wire on the inside are visible.

              near one thousand light-bulbs inside the <i>nebuta</i> made its 
              full impact on the audience. Minamoto no Yoshitsune will now be
