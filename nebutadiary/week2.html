            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#CCFFFF">'It 
              looks like a modern art installation', said one visitor today about 
              the wood and wire structure which is now more or less complete. 
              The Kitamura brothers and Max Marshall are finalising details around 
              the front of the float, constructing further waves out of which 
              the warrior and horse appear to emerge. Each wave is first shaped 
              on the floor with an outline of wire and then given a sculptural 
              three-dimensional form which will stand on end. The overall form 
              of the water along the front of the float is given particular attention: 
              although a structurally simple wire grid, the curve of the wave 
              and of the water beneath is what will partly define the dynamism 
              of the scene. </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#CCFFFF">Planning 
              for later stages is constantly in the mind of the artist: some of 
              the waves are made on separate wooden bases that can be moved out 
              of the way to facilitate access for the electrics to be installed 
              and the structure covered with paper. They will be moved back in 
              towards the centre of the float and attached to it once these later 
              stages have taken place. </font></p>

            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#CCFFFF">Today 
              is the first time the design for the back of the float was revealed. 
              Some of the wire parts for the back had been made by Takashi Kitamura 
              in advance in Japan and were laid on the floor of the gallery until 
              today: a head, two arms, a number of shapes of buds and long ribbons. 
              These parts had suggested this would be a Buddhist scene and suddenly 
              today, the head and arms were raised and a figure emerged sitting 
              on a lotus flower. The presence of only one foot which so many visitors 
              had queried when looking at the wire parts was finally explained 
              by the fact that the other foot remains hidden under the robes of 
              the figure. Sitting at the back of the float, the figure now looks 
              straight into the eyes of another Buddhist figure in the Oriental 
              Galleries, through the door of the Wellcome Trust Gallery and beyond 
              the stairs. </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#CCFFFF">Meanwhile, 
              Mr and Mrs Funahashi continue to thread electrical wires through 
              the details of the figure and horse at the front of the float and 
              gradually screwing the bulbs into place. </font></p>

            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#CCFFFF">Today 
              Akira and Takashi Kitamura worked alone on completing the back of 
              the float while Maki Fujiwara helped strengthen the main base of 
              the structure. The design for the back of the float echoes the front 
              through the large expanse of water and tall waves on which the seated 
              figure floats. Takashi Kitamura's sketch for the back was brought 
              out again and careful measurements made to establish the length 
              of the waves, crucial in maintaining the overall proportions of 
              the entire float. However, their shape was entirely decided upon 
              by eye. A book containing reproductions of famous Buddhist paintings 
              was also consulted to confirm details of the folds of the figure's 
              robes. </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#CCFFFF">One 
              of the questions visitors most frequently ask is 'Where are the 
              plans?'. Looking at the small sketch in front of Kitamura as he 
              stands back to assess positioning of yet another detail, it is difficult 
              for some to appreciate just how much of the construction process 
              is done by eye. </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#CCFFFF">The

            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#CCFFFF">Work 
              has started on installing the lights in the horse. First the head 
              is given some lightbulbs, then the legs and finally its wings and 
              neck. Although all the lightbulbs in this part of the float look 
              the same, large and milky white in colour, they are often of a different 
              wattage depending on the overall effect sought after by the artist 
              and electrician working together. </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#CCFFFF">Most 
              of today was spent tidying up the wire structure, either where details 
              join together, such as between head and neck of the figure at the 
              back, or between the upper wire structure and the wooden base to 
              which it is attached. This is particularly important in anticipation 
              of the papering work which will need to join the two (the top and 
              the base) in seamless fashion so that every single part of the wood 
              or wire structure is covered. </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#CCFFFF">Finally, 
              towards the end of the afternoon, there was an overall sense of 
              completion with Minamoto no Yoshitsune and his horse and the back 
              scene fully constructed. While the electrical team continued to 
              work at their measured pace, Takashi and Akira Kitamura began to 
              prepare the area for when the women would start working on Tuesday. 
              Standing back, they assessed the placement of the scaffold equipment, 
              positioning the stepladders and laying and fixing the boards between 
              them. By the end of the day, a complex walkway of boards had been 
              created around and between the human figure and the horse at the 
              front of the float. A gap between the back and front of the float 
              is wide enough to allow access to the team and will be narrowed 
              at the end when the completed sections of the float are joined together.

            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#CCFFFF">With 
              everything in place for papering to start, the artistic team have 
              taken a day off and will return to work tomorrow. Only Katsutoshi 
              and Michiko Funahashi continue to work, patiently installing the 
              hundreds of light bulbs. Indeed, the electrical wiring needs to 
              be fully in place before the structure can be covered with paper. 
              The complexity of the design creates a new challenge for their work: 
              rather than large wide expanses in the central area of the float, 
              Takashi Kitamura's design here includes manyfine details, all of 
              which need illuminating: arms, fingers, details of the warrior's 
              armour; not just expanses of water but complex waves rising from 
              the base and exploding into countless numbers extremities to create 
              the spume at the top of the wave. As in the case of the wire parts, 
              some preparations for the electrical work were carried out in Japan 
              prior to the team's arrival in London. For example, each socket 
              arrives equiped with wire twisted round it so that it can be immediately 
              attached to the wood and wire frame. Focusing on one detail of the 
              structure at a time, each socket is placed and attached with its 
              wires hanging down. A longer central cable is then made to run between 
              the sockets, each wire connected to it as the work progresse. Finally, 
              the bulbs themselves are put in place. Michiko Funahashi keeps a 
              careful record of the numbers of bulbs and their strength to monitor 
              the composition of each separate circuit. While the Kitamura brothers, 
              Max Marshall and Maki Fujiwara had been mainly working from the 
              outside of the structure, Katsutoshi and Michiko Funahashi have 
              been working more and more from the inside as the complexity of 
              the wiring moves away from the edges of the float and gather towards 
              the floor level at the centre. <br>

            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#CCFFFF">This 
              is the first day for the full team to be at work. The five women 
              have now joined the work force and will be primarily responsible 
              for covering the wire structure with paper. The first part of the 
              morning consisted in getting their equipment ready: aprons (to protect 
              their clothes from the PVA glue and water), plastic cups in which 
              to put the glue, toothbrushes which will serve to apply the glue 
              along the wire, a small cutter to neatly cut the paper along the 
              lines of the wire, scissors to tidy up the edges and a damp rag 
              on which to wipe fingers and tools. A clever hook made of wire is 
              designed to hold the plastic cup so that it can be hung on the <i>nebuta</i> 
              at a convenient height for dipping in the brush and moved along 
              as work progresses. Finally, each person is provided with a plastic 
              bag, also tied to the wire structure of the <i>nebuta</i>, so that 
              all unused paper can be thrown immediately rather than left to litter 
              the floor or the scaffold boards. </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#CCFFFF">Work 
              started on the head of the main figure, Tomoko Kitamura and Miyuki 
              Oda concentrating on the front of the helmet while Reiko Kitamura, 
              Keiko Osanai and Tokuko Iwasaki worked on the top and sides of the 
              helmet. Meanwhile, less experienced members of the team were set 
              to work on parts of the <i>nebuta</i> which will ultimately be less 
              visible to the public. </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#CCFFFF">Takashi 
              and Akira Kitamura and Max Marshall spent most of the morning and 
              early afternoon constructing boxes out of wood. These will be used 
              ultimately to decorate the platform on which the <i>nebuta</i> will 
              stand. Referred to as 'sponsor boxes', these play an important role 
              in acknowledging the larger groups and companies that have contributed 
              to the construction of the float. </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#CCFFFF">But 
              at the end of the day, they joined in the papering. Bar Mr and Mrs 
              Funahashi, still concentrating on the electrics, the entire team 
              is now involved in covering the <i>nebuta</i> in paper. </font></p>

              of the waves. The front of the float is now more or less completely 
              installed with light bulbs and the horse is occasionally fully lit, 
              to the delight of passing visitors. Meanwhile, the papering continues. 
              This is one of the longest stages of the construction process: every 
              single space in the wire grid forming the outer structure of the 
              <i>nebuta</i> is covered with an individual piece of paper cut to 
              size. First a piece of paper is measured to fit approximately the 
              space between the wires. Then the glue is applied along the wire 
              with the toothbrush. The paper is carefully placed over the area, 
              stretched by applying pressure on the highest points so that the 
              paper will curve out. The edges are then tidied up with the cutter 
              or scissors and stuck down by a last application of glue with one 
              finger. </font></p>

              The men are mainly working on the horse's wings while part of a 
              thigh and a foot are also beginning to look more shapely now that 
              the paper defnes the wire form in bold white patches. The face will 
              be left until last and receive particular care: 'It is a great honour
