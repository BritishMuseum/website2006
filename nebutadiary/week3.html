              is a quiet day in the gallery, with fewer visitors passing through. 
              The entire team is concentrated on covering the wire structure with 
              paper. As Reiko Kitamura first described this stage of the process, 
              'one forgets time is passing'. It is an absorbing task, slow and 
              meticulous, and relatively little conversation takes place while 
              work continues on the papering. When working in Aomori, a radio 
              is often playing in the background, but here some of the team members 
              have opted for personal stereos, while others occasionally chat 
              quietly when working near to each other. Katsutoshi and Michiko 
              Funahashi's work involves more discussion. As all the electrics 
              are to Japanese standard (110v), eight transformers will provide 
              the link between the <i>nebuta</i> and the mains. The Funahashi 
              thus need to keep track of the number of light-bulbs and their wattage 
              to ensure even and consistent wiring. This is done partly by keeping 
              detailed notes. Although the amount and type of light-bulbs is estimated 
              early on in the project, their placing and exact number are determined 
              by the wire form once constructed and evaluated as the wiring progresses.

            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#CCFFFF" size="2">By 
              the end of the working day, most of the human figure representing 
              Minamoto no Yoshitsune was covered with paper. Constituting a white 
              mass on one side of the <i>nebuta</i>, the figure looks strangely 
              unbalanced compared to the lighter wire structures still surrounding 
              it. One visitor described it as a ‘sad snowman toppling over' and 
              seeming to reach out with a stick (the sword has not yet been covered 
              in paper). Visitors' comments have changed over the last few days: 
              the basic wood/wire structure drew people to compare it with modern 
              art installations, but many now state a preference for the ‘pure' 
              white form covered in paper. The paper makes it easier to understand 
              the shapes as it defines the outer wire grid and hides the internal 
              wood structure. It moulds the wire grid so perfectly that it looks 
              as though the white is a fabric stretched over the wire. One of 
              the most frequent explanations that is made to visitors is about 
              the technique of covering each space of the wire grid with one piece 
              of paper cut to size. This inevitably seems to draw people to ask 
              about the paper and if they could have some of the scraps that are 
              being thrown away. Most <i>nebuta</i> artists use hoshoshi, a thick 
              fibrous paper made with one of the papermaking mulberries, sometimes 
              used for indoor screens; in this case, the paper is an industrial 
              variant with fire-retardant properties. </font></p>

            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#CCFFFF">The 
              papering continues. Takashi Kitamura has moved over to work on the 
              horse's head while others complete parts of the figure's armour. 
              The volunteers have been training for the best part of this week 
              on sections that were both large and with relatively little curve 
              in the wire, invisible to the public. This was ideal training ground, 
              but today, some are being allowed to work on the front and the sides, 
              including on parts of the figure's armour. In the afternoon, most 
              of the team moved over to work on the horse. Only Miyuki Oda was 
              working on Minamoto no Yoshitsune, having been invited to cover 
              the face of the figure. She has been chosen for this work in recognition 
              of her particular skills and delicate touch in the application of 
              paper to the wire. With a number of North American visitors enquiring 
              about the papering process, a long discussion took place today on 
              the simplicity of the materials used to construct a <i>nebuta</i>. 
              A simple combination of wood, wire, thick paper and glue brought 
              out discussions on different carpentry techniques, how to create 
              a smooth concrete by adding a water soluble adhesive to the mixture, 
              and many tricks of the trade. Visitors brought their own experiences 
              to bear on their understanding of the processes and products involved 
              and translated for each other. For example, the glue used to stick 
              the paper to the wire of the <i>nebuta</i> is a water soluble white 
              adhesive which most people were familiar with but knew under different 
              names depending on their country of origin: ‘PVA glue' in the UK 
              (from its chemical description, Poly Vinyl Acetate), ‘bondo' in 
              Japan (from the word to ‘bond' and the trademark Bondex) and the 
              trademark ‘Elmer's glue' in the United States. </font></p>

            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#CCFFFF" size="2">With 
              Mondays now well-established as the day off for the whole team, 
              the aim is often to complete a task by Sunday night so that a new 
              phase of construction can be started on the Tuesday. Decorating 
              the paper structure is due to begin next week, but there is some 
              anxiety as to the tight schedule within which the construction of 
              the float has to be completed. Today, the idea is to finish the 
              papering of the front, i.e. the human figure and the horse, so that 
              next week Takashi Kitamura can begin to outline here the details 
              of the design in ink and wax while work can begin on papering the 
              back of the <i>nebuta</i>. Smaller sub-teams were forming and dispersing 
              throughout the day as the team moved across the front of the structure. 
              By mid-afternoon, the papering on Minaomoto no Yoshitsune was nearly 
              done as Maki Fujiwara, Miyuki Oda and Keiko Osanai continued to 
              work around the base of the figure. Meanwhile, the rest of the team 
              focused on the horse with Takashi Kitamura working on the horse's 
              mane, Tokuko Iwasaki completing the details on the horse's head, 
              Reiko Kitamura and Tomoko Kitamura working on the neck, Akira Kitamura 
              and Maximilian Marshall on the wings and volunteers getting on with 
              the sections they have been appointed. Finally, the electrical wiring 
              was completed by Katsutoshi and Michiko Funahashi. Final checks 
              will still have to be done, but all the light-bulbs are installed 
              and the <i>nebuta</i> is ready to be lit. </font></p>

            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#CCFFFF" size="2">The 
              back of the <i>nebuta</i> is a separate wood and wire structure 
              that can be lifted apart from the rest of the float. It actually 
              rests on its own wood grid, itself resting partly on the main base 
              of the entire float and partly on the floor, held up by small wedges. 
              The <i>nebuta</i> are often made thus in two, three or more parts. 
              The space between the parts makes it possible to create a walkway 
              with scaffold boards between and around all the parts and thus allowing 
              access to the higher details of the wire structure. The back of 
              a <i>nebuta</i> usually depicts a separate but complementary scene 
              to the one on the front. Here, the back of the <i>nebuta</i> depicts 
              the Buddhist figure Kannon on a lotus flower, floating in the cusp 
              of a wave with the sea raging around it. This echoes the theme of 
              this <i>nebuta</i>, ‘Minamoto no Yoshitsune crossing the sea', and 
              the benevolent gods that helped him escape from certain death at 
              the hands of his brother. Takashi Kitamura is particularly known 
              for the water effects of his <i>nebuta</i> and he often chooses 
              to depict dramatic scenes involving turbulent seas and crashing 
              waves. Here, the shape of the wave is reminiscent of early 19th 
              century Japanese woodblock prints and in particular perhaps the 
              most famous one titled ‘<a href="compass/ixbin/goto?id=OBJ393">Under
              the wave, off Kanagawa' by Katshushika Hokusai</a> with a boat caught 
              in the cusp of the wave. Such cross-references in the iconography 
              of the <i>nebuta</i> are part of the visual puns contained in the 
              imagery depicted on floats in Aomori. </font></p>

            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#CCFFFF">During 
              the early part of the day, most of the women on the team prepared 
              the area for the next stage of the process. One side of the <i>nebuta</i> 
              display area was to be devoted to the ink and wax: the inks and 
              brushes were laid out and the floor protected with cardboard and 
              the table cleared to set out the hot plates on which the wax will 
              be melted. Meanwhile on the other side, the area was prepared for 
              the poster paints and the following materials were set out: brushes, 
              over 20 small pots of poster paints, plastic containers in which 
              the colours will be diluted and mixed, scrap paper for testing the 
              intensity of the dye, and plenty of old newspapers which will be 
              used to protect the sculpture beneath the areas where painting work 
              is to be carried out. Meanwhile, since many of the scaffold boards 
              had been moved around during the papering of the front of the <i>nebuta</i>, 
              Takashi and Akira Kitamura re-arranged the boards to maximise access 
              for decorating the float. Once this was ready, most of the team 
              returned to papering on the back of the <i>nebuta</i> and the water 
              details of the front. The details of the foam were made of wire 
              in advance in Japan and shipped over with the other parts of the 
              <i>nebuta</i> at the start of the project, but the overall shape 
              of the two waves and their positioning was determined by eye by 
              Takashi Kitamura during construction. The water features combine 
              both areas that are relatively simple to cover in paper towards 
              the base of the waves, but the foam requires more time and attention. 
              This made them ideal for training those on the team with less experience 
              in papering. Takashi Kitamura's fame for water details goes hand 
              in hand with a reputation for making the task particularly difficult 
              for the papering team! </font></p>
