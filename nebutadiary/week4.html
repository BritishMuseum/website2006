              again, most of the team is involved in covering with paper the waves 
              and the Kannon figure at the back, while Takashi Kitamura begins 
              decorating the front. With the addition of ink and charcoal lines, 
              details of the features of the human figure and the horse are beginning 
              to emerge from the plain white paper sculpture. The black ink is 
              used to outline the design, for example differentiating between 
              the different parts of Minamoto no Yoshitsune's clothing and adding 
              dynamism to the cloth pattern by indicating the folds in the sleeves. 
              The charcoal provides the lines which will be followed in the application 
              of molten paraffin wax. Many of the patterns on the clothing are 
              made with a stencil initially cut out of paper (so that it can be 
              wrapped around the shapes of the <i>nebuta</i>) or thin card. Takashi 
              Kitamura has brought a couple of Japanese pattern reference books 
              and uses them as a source of inspiration. For example, the crest 
              pattern on the right arm sleeve and trousers showing gentian blossoms 
              (identified with Yoshitsune's family crest) is combined with five 
              bamboo leaves to form the sasa-rind which became a common decorative 
              pattern for garments during the Edo period in Japan. With most of 
              the electrical work out of the way, Michiko Funahashi and even Katsutoshi 
              Funahashi join the papering team. In Aomori, tasks are quite clearly 
              divided between those with relevant experience in the different 
              stages of the construction. The papering would be done mostly by 
              women and the Funahashi would not normally be involved in anything 
              but the electrical wiring. However, with the pressure of time and 
              a small team, the construction of the <i>nebuta</i> at The British 
              Museum is an occasion for all to join in. </font></p>

            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#CCFFFF">One 
              of the most important processes in the construction of a <i>nebuta</i> 
              started today. This involves melting paraffin wax and applying it 
              with thin brushes to the paper covering the wire structure. It is 
              a form of resist-dye technique, but, unlike batik for example, the 
              wax is absorbed by the paper and will remain part of the finished 
              construction. The wax is used to separate the colours but also to 
              create translucent areas. The lighting inside the <i>nebuta</i> 
              is turned on and off to assess the overall effect as the wax decoration 
              progresses. With relatively low levels of lighting in the gallery 
              space, the back of the float is lit up most of the day simply to 
              help the papering team in their work. Tomoko Kitamura prepared the 
              first batch of wax, tipping a shallow layer of white pellets of 
              unscented wax into the small metal buckets which were left to heat 
              on the hot plates. Once the wax is liquid, it is carried over to 
              where the work is being carried out on the <i>nebuta</i>. The two 
              husband and wife teams, Takashi and Tomoko Kitamura and Akira and 
              Reiko Kitamura, together with Maximilian Marshall, set to work. 
              The wax is painted on with slim paint brushes, following the lines 
              of the charcoal drawings already in place. As soon as the wax in 
              the bucket cools and becomes too stiff to be painted on, another 
              bucket is handed over. A routine is soon in place: Katsutoshi Funahashi 
              is enlisted to watch over the melting wax and to bring over a replacement 
              bucket of warm wax whenever required by the other five perched on 
              the scaffold boards. </font></p>

              paper was still being applied to the back of the float, the application 
              of the wax continued with the same routine established yesterday. 
              Whilst most of the wax is being applied with brushes, today Tomoko 
              Kitamura is using a brush with a small wad of cloth at the end of 
              it to create the dots of the pattern on the clothing. The wax appears 
              as dark grey lines on the white paper, but the effect is reversed 
              when the paper is lit from behind with the wax pattern standing 
              out brightly. By the end of the day, the wax and ink lines were 
              completed on the figure of Minamoto no Yoshitsune. A small group 
              of young people came to visit the <i>nebuta</i> construction site 
              in anticipation of the lantern workshop they were attending in the 
              Museum towards the end of the morning. Throughout the afternoon, 
              they walked through the gallery on their way home, carrying lanterns 
              they had made with willow (or withy) and tissue paper. This combination 
              of withy and tissue paper is more commonly used in Britain to create 
              lanterns. Similarly in Japan, lanterns of the <i>nebuta</i> type 
              were made with slit bamboo before wire became widely available in 
              the first half of the 20th century. In the Aomori region, bamboo 
              is still used for smaller <i>nebuta</i>, and in particular during 
              workshops at which children learn the basic methods of <i>nebuta</i> 
              construction. However, to achieve the light effects for which the 
              <i>nebuta</i> are so famous, Aomori artists prefer a thick fibrous 
              paper to tissue paper. This also makes the float stronger to sustain 
              the vigorous handling during the procession. </font></p>

            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#CCFFFF">The 
              smell of wax has cleared by the time the team set to work again 
              in the morning. Although this particular wax is said to be odourless, 
              by the end of each day, the smell of hot wax has invaded the gallery. 
              Several regular visitors who have been monitoring progress of the 
              construction on a weekly basis commented on the multisensorial experience 
              of the exhibition as they have watched the <i>nebuta</i> grow, handled 
              the paper and now smell the wax. Minamoto no Yoshitsune and his 
              complex costume design having been finished, work begins on the 
              horse. This is a much less complex design of wax lines: only a number 
              of near complete circles are painted with the wax to create the 
              mottled effect of the horse's coat. Meanwhile, one side of the gallery 
              has become a focus of activity as all the poster paints are brought 
              out and the mixing of bright colours begins to decorate the clothing 
              of Minamoto no Yoshitsune. The first sections to be decorated are 
              parts of the armour and the design of red crosses that represent 
              the network of cords holding together the articulated plates that 
              make up the armour. Miyuki Oda has been called away from the papering 
              team to help with the painting. In the afternoon, Takashi Kitamura 
              draws the ink lines on the face of Yoshitsune and the eyes in particular. 
              This is one of the most crucial aspects of the overall effect of 
              the <i>nebuta</i> float. The gaze is what will give life to the 
              design. During the festival, when the floats are in movement, judges 
              and spectators will assess their quality partly by the way in which 
              the gaze of the main human figures hits the crowd as the floats 
              are rotated and moved through the procession. </font></p>

              focus on the front of the float is now on the colour and the team 
              is spread out evenly on both sides of the <i>nebuta</i>. Part of 
              the team is at the back with Maki Fujiwara, Tokuko Iwasaki, Keiko 
              Osanai and volunteers completing the papering of the Kannon figure 
              and the waves. The others are all around the front, working on the 
              scaffold boards at different levels and moving fast as the painting 
              progresses. The colours are applied either uniformly or with gradation 
              to create depth. This is achieved by means of a wide flat brush: 
              one side is dipped into thicker paint and the other into a diluted 
              version of the same colour. The brush is then applied flat against 
              the paper thus creating a colour line graded in its width. The choice 
              of colour is determined by the painting which Takashi Kitamura did 
              to depict his chosen design for this <i>nebuta</i>. This painting, 
              together with history books on the design of Japanese medieval armour, 
              are regularly referred to by Takashi and Akira Kitamura in coordinating 
              the work of those applying the colours. </font></p>

              a few holes where the scaffold boards are still resting on the internal 
              structure of the <i>nebuta</i>, the outer wire form of the <i>nebuta</i> 
              is now completely covered in paper. The papering team and volunteers 
              are relieved to see this stage finished and are looking forward 
              to moving on to other tasks. This has been by far the most demanding 
              aspect of the construction, with an average of 10 people working 
              at it intensively for over 10 days. Each new process hides the preceding 
              stages of construction: now that the wood and wire structure is 
              hidden by the paper, questions from visitors are increasingly focusing 
              on trying to understand how the <i>nebuta</i> is held up on the 
              inside. One child thought that perhaps it was filled with air... 
              With the addition of colour, the difference in light effects achieved 
              through the variety of light-bulbs in place is increasingly visible. 
              The fluorescent tubes highlight the cold colours such as the blue 
              of the sword blade or the water. Similarly, behind the paper covering 
              the front details of Minamoto no Yoshitsune's helmet, there are 
              both fluorescent tubes and small clear bulbs, illustrating a range 
              of metals from a warm bronze to bright gold although the paper itself 
              is all painted with the same vivid yellow. Some further wax work 
              is taking place, in particular in the decoration of the waves. Akira 
              Kitamura uses a small brush which he aims towards the paper and 
              flicks against the edge of a small tin in which he has poured a 
              little molten wax. Flecks of wax are thus dispersed over the paper, 
              particularly at the top of the waves. Where drops of wax have fallen, 
              the blue of the paint will not hold when it is applied. The drops 
              of wax thus remaining white will become realistic flecks of foam 
              as though dropped from the top of the overhanging wave. </font></p>
