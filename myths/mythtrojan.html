          Troy's doom was sealed when Paris was born. So declared Cassandra, the 
          prophetic princess. King Priam and his wife Hecuba resolved to destroy 
          their baby rather than endanger the city. But Paris, exposed to die, 
          was rescued by shepherds. When he reached manhood he was obliged to 
          judge which of three goddesses, Juno, Minerva or Venus was the most 
          beautiful (Fig 1). All three offered bribes, but only Venus' offer of 
          the most beautiful woman in the world proved irresistible. Paris awarded 
          her the prize and in exchange Venus helped him to steal Helen, then 
          married to a Greek king, away to Troy where Paris had been accepted 
          back into the royal family (Fig 2).</font></p>
        <p></p>
        <p class="mainYel"> 
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFCC00"><span class="mainYel">The 
          Greeks, enraged at the theft of Helen mustered a great army under the 
          leadership of Agamemnon, brother of the aggrieved husband of Helen, 
          and prepared to attack Troy. But before they could set out, in exchange 
          for a fair wind, the goddess Diana demanded a dreadful sacrifice: Agamemnon's 
          virgin daughter, Iphigeneia. The sacrifice was performed and the wind 
          rose, but unknown to Agamemnon and his distraught wife, Clytemnestra, 
          at the last moment, Diana had rescued the girl, substituting a deer 
          in her place (Fig 3).</span></font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><span class="mainWhi">The 
          Greeks then sailed to Troy. On the Greek side, Achilles proved the greatest 
          warrior, while on the Trojan side, Priam and Hecuba's eldest son, Hector, 
          became the chief defender of the city. But it was only after Hector 
          had slain Achilles' beloved friend Patroclus, that Achilles actually 
          met Hector in battle and killed him (Fig 4).</span></font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFCC00"><span class="mainYel">And 
          yet Troy did not fall; the war continued. Achilles was killed; Paris 
          was killed; but the city held out. Finally the Greeks devised a ruse: 
          they pretended to sail home but left a huge hollow wooden horse which 
          was filled with the pick of the Greek soldiery. The wise Cassandra pleaded 
          that it not be brought into the city, but her advice was dismissed. 
          The Trojans, believing the invasion had failed and the war was over, 
          rejoiced, but in the dead of night, the Greeks hidden in the horse emerged, 
          recalled their colleagues hidden nearby and sacked the city.</span></font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><span class="mainWhi">Helen 
          was retrieved by her husband and brought back to Greece (Fig 5); Priam 
          was killed (Fig 6), Cassandra, wrenched from the image of the goddess 
          to which she clung for sanctuary, was raped (Fig 7) and then became 
          the captive of the Greek commander, Agamemnon, while Andromache, faithful 
          wife of Hector, was given as concubine to the son of Achilles. Hector 
          and Andromache's baby, the hope of Troy, was thrown to his death from 
          the walls (also Fig 6). In one last cruel gesture, the Greeks slew Polyxena, 
          a virgin daughter of Priam and Hecuba, sacrificing an innocent Trojan 
          maiden at the end of the war in cruel symmetry with the sacrifice of 
          the Greek maiden, Iphigeneia, at the beginning.</span></font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFCC00"><span class="mainYel">Agamemnon's 
          homecoming was joyless. His resentful wife, Clytemnestra, with the aid 
          of her lover, Aegisthus, murdered him and Cassandra upon their arrival. 
          Years passed before Agamemnon's son, Orestes, and daughter, Electra, 
          could avenge his death by killing their mother and her paramour. To 
          the only surviving member of the Trojan royal family, fate was kinder. 
          Aeneas, cousin of Hector, escaped from the fallen city with his father 
          and little son Ascanius. They set off for Italy, to settle such Trojans 
          as had escaped the sack and would ultimately be the founders of Rome. 
          Along the way they stopped at Carthage, where the Queen, Dido, fell 
          in love with Aeneas. But fate overruled passion and Aeneas, following 
          his destiny, was forced to abandon the besotted Dido, who found refuge 
          only in death.</span></font></p>
