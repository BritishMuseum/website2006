      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">6. All materials and

      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">9. All objects must 
        be handled as little and as carefully as possible. If they have to be 
        handled then clean hands are essential and some objects may only be handled 
        whilst wearing gloves. These will be specified by the Study Room Supervisor 
        and suitable gloves provided. Any handling instructions given by curatorial 
        staff must be observed and the handling of objects will be monitored by 
        Study Room staff. </font>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">10. If it is necessary 
        to pick up an object for examination, it must be held over the foam sheet 
        provided. </font>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">11. Objects not being

      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">15. Students must 
        ask for permission to take photographs, for personal study purposes, and 
        this is at the discretion of the relevant curator. Permission is granted 
        on condition that extreme care is exercised in setting up the camera and 
        handling the objects and that other students are not inconvenienced. Alternatively, 
        the Museum=s Photographic Service undertakes public orders, please ask 
        the supervisor for information. </font>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">16. Visitors may not 
        leave the Study Room until the Study Room Supervisor is satisfied that 
        all objects provided for study are accounted for and in good order. (This 
        process can take some time, and you may be asked to conclude your studies 
        early in order for this object check to be completed). Students should 
        ensure that the Supervisor signs the application form acknowledging their 
        return. </font>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">17. It may be necessary 
        to close the Study Room without notice in case of shortage of staff or 
        an emergency e.g. fire or security alert. The Museum has set procedures 
        to be followed in an emergency and for your own safety, any instructions 
        given by museum staff must be acted upon immediately. This may involve 
        evacuating the building and students must accept that there may not be 
        time for the dismantling of apparatus such as cameras. </font>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">18. Failure to observe 
        these rules may result in the temporary or permanent withdrawal of study 
        facilities. Visitors who are not already known personally to a member 
        of the Department must provide a letter of introduction or other reference 
        from a Professor, supervisor or other qualified person.</font>
