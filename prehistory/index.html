      <P><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color=#ffffcc size=2>One of 
      the defining characteristics of being human is the creation of objects, 
      first seen some 2.5 million years ago at Olduvai Gorge, Tanzania. 
      Artefacts gave instant advantage in the quest for food and security, but 
      these functional objects progressively took on other meanings and values. 
      They came to symbolise human control over animals and the environment and 
      signify relationships with other people and the spiritual world. This new 
      exhibition illustrates the varied ways in which prehistoric objects, both 
      the mundane and the exceptional, could be involved in the exercise of 
      power and control from the earliest times up until the end of the European 
      Bronze Age (800 BC).<BR wp="BR1"><BR wp="BR2">From as early as 1.5 million 
      years ago, during the Lower Palaeolithic period, flint tools of 
      exceptional size were created, such as the Edmonsham handaxe. Size in 
      itself had begun to matter for personal prowess, irrespective of the 
      object's utilitarian value. By the Upper Palaeolithic (35,000 years ago), 
      ornaments were being suspended on body and costume and the first 
      inescapably non-functional objects had appeared. From this remote time on, 
      humans were both creators of artefacts and authors of their meanings. The 
      Upper Palaeolithic also saw the development of sophisticated art 
      represented by a number of exhibits including the extraordinary Montastruc 
      ivory spearthrower in the guise of a mammoth. The artistic focus on 
      animals highlights both human dependence on, and spiritual engagement 
      with, the animal kingdom.<BR wp="BR2"></FONT></P>
      <P><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color=#ffffcc size=2>One of 
      the gallery's thematic sections - 'The Pursuit of Perfection' - explores 
      the human desire to invest artefacts with aesthetic qualities that go 
      beyond the sheer utilitarian and includes the ripple-flaked dagger from 
      Volgu, France, highly polished stone maceheads and the Sintra gold collar. 
      The enigmatic carved 'drums' from Folkton, sculpted balls from Scotland 
      and the splendid bronze horn from Dunmanway are used to make the link 
      between high craftsmanship, status and spirituality. Such aspirations also 
      helped drive the search for exotic materials such as callaïs (variscite), 
      amber or jet.<BR wp="BR2"></FONT></P>
      <P><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color=#ffffcc size=2>Objects 
      often served to convey messages to supernatural forces - gods and 
      ancestors - through funerary offerings, as in the Barnack grave 
      reconstruction, or votive deposits, as in the Lockington and Arreton 
      hoards. The ritual disposal of valuables and the perpetual drive to assert 
      status gave impetus to the accumulation of wealth in later prehistory 
      after the domestication of animals, bolstered by the discovery of metals. 
      Bronze Age artefacts such as the famous Oxborough dirk, which was 
      discovered by chance in 1990 set vertically in the soil, illustrate this 
      later development.<BR wp="BR1"></FONT></P>
      <P><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color=#ffffcc size=2>Many of 
      the gallery's messages come together in its iconic centrepiece, the 
      magnificent ceremonial gold cape from Mold, north-east Wales, restored 
      anew specially for this exhibition.</FONT></P>
