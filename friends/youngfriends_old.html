      Join a child as a Young Friend and open up the wonders of the British Museum for them. Membership of the Young Friends is a great way for children to get closer to the Museum and learn more about its wonderful collections. Membership is open to children from the ages of 8-15, and for just &pound;20 a year allows a child the following benefits:</p>
      <ul>
        <li class="bullettextblack">ReMUS, the magazine of the Young Friends, delivered three times a year. ReMUS contains articles about all the Museum&rsquo;s latest exhibitions and collections, interviews with curators, and information about all the upcoming Young Friends events, including sleepovers.</li>
        <li class="bullettextblack">Free entry to four Special Family Evenings, featuring talks, craft activities, storytelling and much more.</li>
        <li class="bullettextblack">Free entry to all British Museum exhibitions.</li>
      </ul>      
      <p class="maintextblack">Events for Young Friends run throughout the year, particularly during half-terms and holidays. The most popular of all these are the sleepovers. Young Friends arrive in the early evening and enjoy a range of activities including talks by curators, craft activities, storytelling and lots more, all themed around the Museum&rsquo;s collections and current exhibitions. They then get into their sleeping bags and spent the night in the Museum&rsquo;s galleries, surrounded by giant ancient sculptures and statues. <br>
        <br>
        There are currently four sleepovers a year, and it is important to book early as these get very popular. There are also other exciting events run, such as behind-the-scenes visits with Museum curators, drama workshops, visits to other museums, and more besides.<br>
