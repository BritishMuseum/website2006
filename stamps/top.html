				<span class="type">Alexander the Great (356-323 BC) <br>
					was the son of Philip II of Macedon <br>
					and Olympias. Philip united his<br>
			native Macedonia before conquering<br>
					 the rest of mainland Greece. Alexander<br>
					 was educated by eminent Greek teachers <br>
					including Aristotle. After Philip&#146;s<br>
					 assassination in 336 BC Alexander began<br>
			expanding his territory, extending the boundary of the<br>
			Greek world to Egypt in the south and India in the east.<br>
			He died in Babylon.</span></font></p>
				<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF"><span class="type">Alexander is said to have carefully controlled the numerous representations of his portrait set up throughout his empire, allowing only a few sculptors and painters to produce his image. His posthumous portraits such as this follow similar general characteristics, although they vary in style. They show a more youthful, though perhaps more god-like character. He is clean-shaven, has longer hair, a more dynamic tilt of the head and an upward gaze. For a ruler to be shown without a beard was an innovation. Alexander was deified in his own lifetime, and after his death he was worshipped as a god in images such<br>
			as this.
