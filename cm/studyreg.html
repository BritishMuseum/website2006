      <p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color=#000000 size=2>1. The 
        Study Room is usually open on weekdays from 10 am to 1.00 pm, and 2.15 
        pm to 4.00 pm (closed Wed. mornings). Students will not normally be admitted 
        after 3.45 pm. I</font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color=#000000 size=2>nformation 
        on the schedule of available days can be obtained by ringing the Department's 
        enquiry number (020 7323 8607 or 8404). </font> 
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color=#000000 size=2>2. Space 
        in the Study Room is limited, and visitors are advised to make an appointment. 
        Bookings across a several day period will be cancelled if a visitor fails 
        to arrive for the first session, unless later bookings are confirmed.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color=#000000 size=2>3. Applications 
        for admission must be supported:</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color=#000000 
      size=2><strong>either</strong> by a member of the academic staff of the 
        Museum from genuine personal knowledge; <strong>or</strong> photographic 
        proof of identity (e.g.passport or driving licence) <strong>and</strong> 
        proof of address (e.g. a recent utility bill). British Library Readers 
        may use the library, on production of their Reader's Ticket, but cannot 
        examine objects without the above identification.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color=#000000 size=2>4. Before 
        the examination of objects, visitors must complete a Student's Record 
        Card.</font></p>
      <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" 
      color=#000000 size=2>5. Students must place all bags, cases, handbags and 
      other luggage away from their desk, as instructed by the invigilator. Coats, 
      etc. should be left in the lobby, and not placed upon tables or seats. <br wp="BR1">
      </font> 
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color=#000000 size=2>6. Students 
        must remain within the Study Room, unless escorted by a member of the 
        departmental staff.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color=#000000 size=2>7. Students 
        must not smoke, eat, drink or chew gum in the Study Room and are requested 
        to conduct themselves in a quiet and orderly manner. Silence should be 
        observed. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color=#000000 size=2>8. It 
        is general Museum policy not to permit the use of personal stereo systems 
        and mobile phones in the building. This rule applies to Departmental Study 
        Rooms also.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color=#000000 size=2>9. Students 
        examining objects will be closely supervised at all times.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color=#000000 size=2>10. Closed 
        circuit television, with video recording, is in use at all times.</font></p>
      <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color=#000000 
      size=2>11. No more than two trays will be given to a student at one time.<br wp="BR1">
      </font> 
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color=#000000 size=2>12. Students 
        must not normally remove more than one piece at a time from a tray, and 
        must ensure it is returned to its proper place.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color=#000000 size=2>13. Students 
        must take good care not to damage or impair any object or book in the 
        collection.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color=#000000 size=2>14. Students 
        wishing to compare their own pieces with those in the Department must 
        obtain the consent of the supervising officer, who will arrange for them 
        to be photographed before the comparison is made.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color=#000000 size=2>15. Personal 
        photography is not permitted, nor is the making of wax or other impressions 
        (including rubbings), except at the discretion of the Keeper or senior 
        staff member. Any requests for consideration should be made in writing 
        well in advance of a visit.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color=#000000 size=2>16. A 
        student may not leave the Study Room until the supervising officer is 
        satisfied that all trays examined by him/her are in good order.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color=#000000 size=2>17. In 
        the event of a fire or security alert students will be required to follow 
        all instructions given by members of the Departmental staff. This will 
        normally involve immediate evacuation.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color=#000000 size=2>18. Infringement 
        of the Regulations may, at the discretion of the Keeper, result in exclusion 
        from the Study Room.</font></p>
