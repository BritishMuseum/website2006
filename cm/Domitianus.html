      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The discovery of a 
        coin of a hitherto much disputed rebel Roman 'emperor' - Domitianus looks 
        set to rewrite history. The coin, part of a hoard, was discovered by Brian 
        Malin whilst using a metal-detector on farmland at Chalgrove, Oxfordshire 
        in April 2003.<br>
        </font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">So little is 
        known of Domitianus that his existence was doubted by many scholars. The 
        new discovery makes it certain both that this shadowy claimant to the 
        Imperial throne existed, and that he mounted a serious challenge for the 
        position of emperor in the troubled period of the early 270s AD, known 
        as the '<font color="#000066">Gallic Empire</font>.'<br>
        The antiquity of this coin of Domitianus is beyond doubt as it came from 
        a hoard consisting of over 5,000 common Roman coins fused together in 
        a third century AD pot, which had to be painstakingly separated by British 
        Museum conservators.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Only two, fleeting 
        references, to Domitianus exist in historical sources but neither identify 
        him as a rebel emperor (called 'tyrants' by the official Roman sources). 
        The Byzantine historian Zosimus records that a certain Domitianus was 
        punished for treason by the Emperor Aurelian (ruled AD 270-275). Another, 
        notoriously unreliable compendium, called the Historia Augusta states 
        that a high-ranking army officer of this name was involved in a military 
        uprising during the same reign. Whilst these two, tantalizingly slight 
        pieces of evidence have tended to be rejected in the past, the new coin 
        provides archaeological evidence that shows these accounts can substantially 
        be accepted. We even have a face to go with the rebel emperor's name (although 
        it is unlikely to have been an accurate portrait given its similarity 
        to Victorinus, his predecessor and Tetricus, his successor).</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">There is one other 
        known coin depicting Domitianus in existence, which was found in the Loire 
        area of France in 1900. Since it was unique and unprecedented the coin 
        was disputed as a modern hoax. It then disappeared into the collections 
        of a small museum in western France and has only recently been traced. 
        The Oxfordshire coin matches the French example and together the coins 
        provide the final indisputable proof of the existence of Domitianus.</font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><br>
        <br>
        The 'The Gallic Empire' is the name given to the secessionist state that 
        was created in the aftermath of the Roman Empire's greatest humiliation. 
        In AD260 the Emperor Valerian was captured alive by the Persians. He was 
        used as a living footstool by the Persian king and upon his death was 
        stuffed and displayed in a Zoroastrian temple. This was the cue for Gaul 
        (the area comprising modern France and the Rhineland) to revolt in order 
        to look after their own security; taking Britain and initially the Iberian 
        peninsula with it. An officer called Postumus became the first breakaway 
        Gallic 'emperor' with his capital in Trier - this is the probable location 
        for the minting of the Domitianus coin. AD 269 was a particularly turbulent 
        year for the Gallic Empire with three successors to Postumus staking rival 
        claims. Finally power settled on Victorinus (r.AD269-71). Victorinus was 
        reportedly prone to raping the wives of his courtiers. It is possible 
        that Domitianus was one of these wronged husbands who assassinated Victorinus, 
        briefly seizing power and taking control of the mint. Domitianus must 
        then have been overthrown (in an incident left historically unrecorded) 
        by Tetricus, the governor of Acquitaine who became emperor from AD271-4. 
        Tetricus was subsequently confronted by the Roman emperor, Aurelian who 
        as we have seen punished Domitianus for treason.</font></p>
