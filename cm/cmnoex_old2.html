          Michelangelo: money and medals<br>
          <font color="#333333">Room 69a<br>
          12 January - 25 June 2006 </font></B></FONT></P>
        <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">This exhibition 
          examines Michelangelo's Italy through the medium of coins and medals. 
          The cities of Florence, Michelangelo's birthplace, and Rome, where he 
          lived most of his adult life, dominate, but a wider perspective is provided 
          by the Italian cities he visited, the payments he received, the patrons 
          who tried to obtain his services, and his increasing fame throughout 
          Europe. It concludes with a glimpse at the reputation 'the divine Michelangelo' 
          has enjoyed since his death. </font></P>
        <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Michelangelo's career 
          stands at the climax of the development of the Renaissance artist in 
          status, reputation and, of course, wealth. Money played a hugely important 
          part in his life and artistic work and he himself had an intense interest 
          in enhancing his personal and family fortune, sometimes to the point 
          of sharp practice. His income and wealth were staggering for the standards 
          of his day, and no contemporary artist could approach him in this: for 
          example, his salary from Pope Paul III in the 1530s was twelve times 
          as much as the Emperor Charles V was paying Titian. Famously, however, 
          he was himself extremely frugal in the manner of his life, so his expenses 
          were generally very low. His wealth would have been even greater had 
          he invested his money, but he usually preferred to hoard much of it 
          in cash. </font></P>
        <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Medals of the time 
          bear portraits of many of the famous contemporaries who played an important 
          role in Michelangelo's life, beginning with his early patron Lorenzo 
          de' Medici and the fiery preacher Girolamo Savonarola, whom he greatly 
          admired, and continuing with the various popes, for whom he produced 
          some of his greatest works, including the Sistine Chapel ceiling and 
          Last Judgment. Friends whose portraits appear on medals include the 
          poet Vittoria Colonna - Michelangelo's muse - and the sculptor Leone 
          Leoni, whose medal of Michelangelo is a rare contemporary portrait of 
          the great artist. Also shown in the exhibition is Alessandro Cesati's 
          portrayal of Alexander the Great and the High Priest of Jerusalem, pronounced 
          by Michelangelo the best medal ever. </font></P>
        <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The exhibition complements 
          Michelangelo drawings - closer to the master by illuminating the difficult 
          and dramatic political circumstances which accompanied the artist's 
          life, and the important and influential network of patrons, friends 
          and artists who surrounded him. It also gives insights into the monetary 
          systems of Michelangelo's world and the economy of a great artist's 
          life, in acknowledgement of this crucial if neglected aspect of his 
          career. </font></P>

        <P align=left><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Like 
          the ancient Persian kings Cyrus, Darius and Xerxes, the Sasanians came 
          from Parsa (Persis) in southern Iran. They were named after Sasan, a 
          legendary ancestor. When Ardashir I killed the Parthian king Ardavan 
          (Artabanus IV) at the battle of Hormizdgan in AD 224, he became the 
          new king of kings of Iran and the dynasty remained in power until the 
          arrival of the Arabs in 642.Yazdgird III, the last Sasanian ruler was 
          murdered in AD 651. </font></P>
        <P align=left><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><BR>
          From the beginning of their rule in AD 224, the Sasanian 
          kings were keen to stress their religious affiliation and their position 
          as the rightful kings of Iran. They were followers of Zoroastrianism, 
          an ancient Iranian religion named after the prophet Zarathustra. Rock-reliefs, 
          coins, silver plates and other small objects always depict the Sasanian 
          king as a ruler who is protected by divine beings and defeats the enemy 
          both at home and abroad. He is the rightful possessor of the khvarenah 
          (modern Persian farr - izadi), the god-Given Glory. With the arrival 
          of Islam in the middle of the seventh century AD, Sasanian iconography 
          does not disappear and the idea of divine kingship is adopted by various 
          Islamic dynasties. In the nineteenth century, the Qajar rulers of Iran 
          imitate the image of the victorious Sasanian king both on rock- reliefs 
          and coins. </font></P>

          and rich history, spanning ancient kingdoms, colonialism and independence. 
          This exhibition takes you on a tour of this dynamic continent through 
          its money, from coins to copper ingots, raffia cloth and cowrie shells. 
          The story begins with the use of weighed metal in Ancient Egypt, and 
          with Africa's earliest coins in Cyrenaica (modern-day Libya) in the 
          sixth century BC. The wealth of Mali, Zimbabwe, and the Swahili Coast 
          show Africa's power and influence before the arrival of European colonisers 
          and slave traders, whose legacy still lingers. Links between money and 
          identity are explored through changes to the coinage during the spread 
          of Christianity and Islam, and the designing of currencies in the twentieth 
          century for newly-independent African countries. </font></P>

          An exploration of the symbolic power of badges and other similar objects 
          to express identity and belonging, belief and dissent. Status Symbols 
          includes objects from around the world and from all periods, ranging 
          from the mass-produced to the individually-crafted; the official to 
          the subversive; the familiar to the strange. All are powerful statements 
          of the diverse ways people define themselves and others. As well as 
          examining attitudes to individual and group identity, the exhibition 
          explores the origin, use and subversion of symbols, and shows how badges 
          can create dialogues between conflicting views.</font></P>

          This exhibition looks at the story of the familiar feature of many of 
          the coins we use today: the side bearing the head of the head of state 
          (in the UK this is HM Queen Elizabeth II). Before the widespread use 
          of photography and the printed image, coins and medals could transmit 
          an image of a ruler far more widely than any other medium - and were 
          therefore an important and convenient way to consolidate power and assert 
          influence. As artefacts, they remain a fascinating record of images 
          of people who lived in times long past. </font></P>
        <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The first portrait 
          coins appeared just before 400 BC in Asia Minor and the display follows 
          the use of personal images on coins up to the time of Napoleon. The 
          latter provides an opportunity through the survival of his death mask 
          to compare his actual face to the official images. </font></P>
        <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In ancient times 
          using the head of a ruler on coins was a way for local issuers to gain 
          credibility by association and in the same way many people wishing to 
          consolidate their position have copied recognised and accepted styles. 
          We can see on some of the earliest Greek portrait coins the development 
          of a feature we still use today, labelling the head with the ruler's 
          name (and sometimes titles), written around the edge of the coin. The 
          use of coin portraits soon spread to ancient Iran in the 2nd century 
          BC and then on to Roman coins. The influence of Roman style coin portraits 
          can clearly be seen in many Renaissance medals as well as painted and 
          engraved portraits, for example a print of about 1500 of the school 
          of Leonardo da Vinci, on show in the exhibition. </font></P>
        <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">We can also see 
          coins that have allowed rulers to manipulate their image and present 
          themselves as anything from warrior to god-like, but perhaps coins which 
          show the ageing of the person depicted are a clue to how concerned some 
          rulers were to presenting a life-like public image. </font></P>

        <P><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size=2>The issuing of money 
      is nowadays regarded as the prerogative of territorial states. Yet, from 
      the ancient world to modern times many cities have had or claimed free and 
      sovereign status, and, with this, the right to issue their own coins. This 
      exhibition focuses on early modern Europe, the 16th to 18th centuries, 
      when city coinages attained arguably their greatest level of artistic 
      achievement. </FONT></P>
      <P><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size=2>The leaders of these 
      cities, mostly in what are now Germany, Switzerland and Eastern Europe, 
      used their coinages to reflect their distinctive character and position, 
      in a world where they were surrounded by dynastic states, with authority 
      vested in princes and kings. Their civic pride, the engraving skills 
      available to them, and the current fashion for physically large coins 
      encouraged them to display on their coins, in the place of a portrait of a 
      ruler, a virtual portrait of the city itself: a panoramic view showing its 
      geographical position, its churches, port, commercial activity, walls and 
      monuments. </FONT></P>
      <P><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size=2>This exhibition is 
      intended to throw light on this little known aspect of coinage, and to 
      place it in the context of urban images in other media.</FONT></P></TD>

      sixteenth-century Italian medals coincides with the publication, in 
      February 2003, of a major British Museum catalogue, Italian medals 
      c.1530-1600 in British public collections. </FONT></P>
      <P><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size=2>The first medals were 
      made in Italy in the 1430s. One hundred years later the Italian medal was 
      firmly established, with princes, clerics, antiquaries, merchants and many 
      others using the medium to signify personal worth. Being portable and 
      durable, medals were recognised as highly effective ways of conveying a 
      message to contemporaries, and also to posterity. Images and inscriptions 
      were carefully chosen to indicate the virtues and events with which those 
      represented on the medals wished to be associated. </FONT></P>
      <P><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size=2>The artists who made 
      medals worked principally in the cities of northern and central Italy, but 
      some travelled to other European countries to serve foreign patrons. 
      Artists such as Leone Leoni and Benvenuto Cellini won international 
      reputations. </FONT></P>

      anniversary medal</B></FONT><BR><B>Exhibition closed</B></FONT></P>
      <P><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size=2>The British Museum, 
      founded in 1753, celebrates its 250th anniversary in 2003. As part of its 
      anniversary celebrations, the Museum has commissioned a medal to 
      commemorate this historic occasion. This medal, by the distinguished 
      British sculptor and Royal Academician John Maine, forms the centrepiece 
      of this exhibition. John Maine's medal design was selected from drawings 
      submitted by four contemporary British artists in a competition organised 
      by the British Museum. The designs of the other three artists, Stephen 
      Cox, Cathy de Monchaux and Tom Phillips, RA, also feature in this 
      exhibition. </FONT></P>
      <P><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size=2>The square, the circle 
      and the triangle of John Maine's anniversary medal suggest the simple 
      geometry underpinning the culturally diverse objects within the 
      collections of the museum. On one side the implied cubic form encircled by 
      the border of the medal evokes an object within the Museum's care; such 
      objects have been at the core of the Museum's activities for two hundred 
      and fifty years. On the other side an allusion to the spectacular roof of 
      the Great Court points to the present and future of the Museum.
