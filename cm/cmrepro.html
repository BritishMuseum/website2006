Unusually, coins of the many third-century usurper emperors, common in other British hoards, are absent in this hoard. Although it was found in 1960, a catalogue has never been produced.

      size=2>As an engraver to the Royal Mint, Leonard Wyon dominated coin and medal production in Britain during the second half of the nineteenth century. His medals portray many of the key figures and important historical events of Victorian Britain. The survival of Wyon's diary provides valuable information about his life, working practices and his links with other artists and institutions. The culmination of this research will be a fully annotated transcript of his diary, with an introduction to the life and work of the engraver and the rest of the Wyon family of artists, and appendices that trace in detail the production and reception of the coins, medals and other objects produced by Wyon and mentioned in the diary. The study is to be published by the British Numismatic Society in 2007.</FONT></P>

          In 2000 an initial volume by Marion Archibald and Barrie Cook published a major group of 12th and 13th century hoards. The next volume will publish details of over thirty coin hoards from the later middle ages, deposited in the period 1279-1485, among them the large Gorefield, Amble, Stanwix and Reigate hoards. The volume will represent a survey of the late medieval English currency, as well as being a straightforward publication of a significant body of research material. </FONT></P>

It is to be published in 2005 and will be a major contribution to early medieval monetary history, with sections of particular significance on the use of money in England after the withdrawal of Rome, the movement of coin and silver around the North Sea and Baltic in the Viking Age, and the development of a unified currency in early medieval England. </FONT></P>

        This project will combine the development of ongoing and existing work by British Museum curators with new work originating in the Barber Institute to produce a cycle of three exhibitions succeeding each other in the Barber's new coin gallery, to be accompanied by a publication with chapters on each of these. The overarching theme is the depiction of architecture and landscape on the miniature forms of money and medals, and the exploration of the origin and purpose of this superficially unlikely development across two millennia of European and Mediterranean history. The book will be prepared during late 2004-2005 and the current plan is for the exhibitions to run between 2005 and 2008/9. </FONT></P>

Coins are the most important historical source for this dynasty. Together with inscriptions and archaeology, they provide an insight into the political, cultural and religious history of this period. The publication of a catalogue of the Kushan coins in the British Museum will be one outcome of this research project. </FONT></P>

      href="http://www.britac.ac.uk/" target=_blank><FONT color=#000066>British Academy</FONT></A> Research Project, the purpose of which is to publish illustrated catalogues of Greek coins in public and private collections in the British Isles. SNG has retained the traditional, very broad, definition of 'Greek' to include the coins produced by all ancient civilisations of the Mediterannean and neighbouring regions except Rome, though it does include the Roman Provincial series often known as 'Greek Imperials'</FONT></P>
        <P><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size=2>The project was inaugurated in 1931 E.S.G. Robinson, curator of Greek coins at the British Museum. A new and distinctive format was used, with text and illustrations on facing pages. This meant that only limited text was included, with the illustrations having greater prominence than in earlier types of catalogues, and to some extent replacing textual descriptions. This is because the primary purpose of SNG was to make much more material available for study. This format has been retained ever since and has been adopted, along with the title Sylloge Nummorum Graecorum, for similar projects in many other countries, including Denmark, France, Germany, Greece, Israel, Sweden, Switzerland and the United States. </FONT></P>

The site has been developed as a castle since shortly after the Norman Conquest. Destroyed and rebuilt on numerous occasions during the Middle Ages, the castle is best known as the least comfortable prison of Mary Queen of Scots during her exile in England. The castle has been in ruin since it was partially destroyed during the English Civil War. The castle is also associated with the Tutbury hoard, the largest hoard of medieval coins found in England, part of which is in the BM collection. A research project is now underway to bring together archaeological and documentary evidence to produce a definitive history of the castle and the surrounding area, incorporating unpublished material from earlier excavations. </FONT></P>

      face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size=2><BR>
        The discovery in 1997 of a hoard of around 500 late Anglo-Saxon coins has prompted a study of the 'Expanding Cross' coinage of Edward the Confessor (1042-66). Apart from a handful of earlier types, all the coins within the hoard are of a heavy sub-type of Expanding Cross, calling into question the established chronology for the type. This project seeks to reassess this coinage against a background of late Anglo-Saxon kingship and economy, and the political events of the reign of Edward the Confessor. A detailed study (and corpus) of the coinage will form a substantial scholarly introduction to a volume of the SCBI series, including the coins of the Expanding Cross and Pointed Helmet types in the BM collection. The Sylloge volume will be published in book form, the catalogue section will at a later date be incorporated into the online database of the SCBI series as a whole. </FONT></P>

      color=#000000>Warfare is one of the defining aspects of the Viking expansion which made such a dramatic impact on the history of northern europe from the late 8th century to c. 1100. This study considers the viking expansion against the background of social and political structures, and seeks to establish to what extent the military activity of 'Vikings' can be distinguished meaningfully from other early medieval warfare. The project considers warfare through a combination of historical and archaeological evidence, and provides the first substantial study in English of the underlying military organisation of Scandinavian forces in this period, and the relationship between changing structures and state formation in the Scandinavian homelands and in the areas they attacked. Publication is planned for Autumn 2005.</FONT></FONT></FONT></P>
