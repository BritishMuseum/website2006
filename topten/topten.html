              Vikings buried this mass of over 8,500 silver coins and objects 
              weighing over 40 kgs. Most of the coins in the hoard came from Britain, 
              but some came from France and a small number from different parts 
              of the Islamic world. Many of the objects are just parts of broken 
              pieces of larger silver objects like brooches. The hoard might have 
              been the war chest to pay a Viking army. It is the largest Viking 
              treasure ever found outside of Russia. </font></p>

            In 1966 the largest hoard of gold coins ever found in Britain was 
            discovered on a building site. As well as 1,237 coins, the hoard contained 
            gold rings and jewellery. The latest coin in the hoard dates to 1464 
            which means these gold objects were buried in 1464 or some time afterwards. 
            This was the period of English history called the Wars of the Roses, 
            a bitter civil war to control the country. Was the gold buried for 
            safe keeping in those unsettled times? Why did the person who buried 
            the gold never collect it again? <br>

            This treasure really was found buried in a chest. The discovery was 
            reported before it was removed from the ground allowing archaeologists 
            to carefully excavate the decayed remains of the chest. It was found 
            to contain over 15,000 gold and silver coins, nearly 100 spoons, gold 
            bracelets and other objects including silver pepper pots. The chest 
            was probably buried for safe keeping during the trouble times when 
            Roman rule was breaking down in Britain, but the owners never came 
            back to recover it. This hoard was buried only a few miles from where 
            the Mildenhall hoard was found. <br>

              These famous chess pieces were found in mysterious circumstances 
              some time before 1831. They were probably made in Norway and are 
              carved from walrus ivory or whales' teeth. Who owned the chess pieces 
              and why they were hidden are even greater mysteries. These small 
              kings, queens, knights and bishops have fascinated people ever since 
              their discovery. Modern chess sets have been modelled on the figures 
              and even Harry Potter played with replica Lewis chessmen in his 
              first film! </font></p>

            This hoard is part of a large silver dinner service. It contains bowls, 
            plates and spoons that some of the richest people in the Roman Empire 
            would have used at dinner or just for show. It includes the Great 
            Dish, a large platter made from 8.2 kgs of silver and measuring 60 
            cms across. The platter is decorated with scenes from Roman pagan 
            mythology, but some of the spoons are marked with Christian symbols. 
            The hoard was found in a ploughed field in 1942. The farmer kept it 
            on his mantel shelf before it came to the British Museum in 1946.<br>

            The cape is made from a thin sheet of decorated gold originally beaten 
            and hammered from a single gold ingot. This elaborate garment was 
            made only a few centuries after people in Britain started to make 
            objects from metal. The cape was probably only worn on special occasions, 
            but it certainly was worn because you can see where it was torn and 
            repaired on one side. The cape is one of the finest examples of prehistoric 
            gold working from Europe. No other object like it has ever been found.

            This gold cup was found in a burial mound on Bodmin Moor in 1837. 
            Gold was a rare and valuable metal in prehistoric times. To be buried 
            with a gold cup probably showed how important the dead person was. 
            Like the Mold Cape, the cup was made from a single lump of gold. Great 
            skill was needed to make the corrugated shape. Only two other gold 
            cups like this one had ever been found in Europe until 2002 when a 
            new larger cup was found at Ringlemere, Kent.<br>

              Torcs were neck rings worn by important people in the years before 
              the Roman Conquest. They were usually made from gold or silver. 
              The largest group of gold torcs ever found in Britain came from 
              Snettisham in Norfolk. The first torcs were found here in 1948 and 
              1950. People thought that there were no more to be found, but in 
              1990 more torcs were discovered carefully buried in the ground. 
              Was this an ancient treasury or bank where valuable objects were 
              kept for safety, or were these torcs buried as gifts to the Gods?</font></p>

              This Anglo Saxon burial is probably the most famous archaeological 
              discovery ever made in Britain. In 1939, a huge mound was excavated 
              revealing the decayed remains of a wooden ship. In the ship there 
              was a burial chamber the size of a small room. It contained a sword, 
              a shield, a helmet, jewellery and a purse. Other objects found included 
              drinking horns, silver bowls made in the east Mediterranean and 
              a decorated bowl from Wales or Ireland. No other burial has ever 
              been found in Britain that is as rich as this one. Mystery surrounds 
              who was buried here, or even if the mound contained a burial at 
              all, as no body was found. </font></p>

              Thin slivers of wet wood are not what many people would think of 
              as treasure. However, these tablets are letters and documents written 
              almost 2000 years ago by soldiers and civilians living at the Roman 
              fortress Vindolanda, near Hadrian's Wall. It is rare to find examples 
              of writing on wood or paper from Britain's ancient past, but these 
              tablets from Vindolanda have survived and they provide a unique 
              window on life in Roman Britain. Because of this, curators at the 
              British Museum think that they are the number one top ten British 
              Treasure in the Museum. </font></p>
