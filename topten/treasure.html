        exactly is Treasure? </font></b><br>
        Treasure is any item found made of more than 10% gold or silver which 
        is over 300 years old, and in the case of coins, two or more such pieces. 
        It also includes 10 or more bronze coins more than 300 years old found 
        in the same locality. Objects found in association with Treasure also 
        count as Treasure, for instance a pottery container with a hoard of Roman 
        coins. </font></p>
      <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#000066">Examples 
        of Treasure</font><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#000000">: 
        a gold medieval finger ring. A hoard of 120 Roman silver and bronze coins 
        with fragments of a pottery container. Single coins found on their own 
        are not treasure and groups of coins lost one by one over a period of 
        time (for example, those found on settlement or fair sites) will not normally 
        be treasure. The best advice is: if in doubt, report your find. </font></p>

        review of the Treasure Act has just been completed, this can also be found

        should I do if I find Treasure or think I might have found Treasure? </font></b><br>
        All Treasure finds must be reported to your local coroner within 14 days. 
        Your local police station or museum will be able to tell you who to contact 
        if you are unsure. Details are also given in the Treasure Act handbook 
        which has a full list of all relevant coroner's in England and Wales. 
        This can be obtained free of charge from Department of Culture, Media 
        & Sport (Tel.: 0207 211 6200). <br>
        </font><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Even if your 
        discovery is not Treasure in the legal sense, it may be a considerable 
        historical importance because of what it can tell us about the past. In 
        England and Wales the Portable Antiquities Scheme has staff across both 
        countries who record discoveries of any ancient artefacts. In Scotland, 
        different laws apply to discoveries of ancient objects. If you find any 
        ancient artefact please take it to your local museum, your local council 
        archaeologist or contact the Treasure Trove Advisory Panel Secretariat 
        at the National Museums of Scotland,Chambers Street, Edinburgh. For more 
        information about the laws surrounding Treasure and discoveries of ancient 
        objects see <a href="http://www.treasuretrove.org.uk/" target="_blank">http://www.treasuretrove.org.uk/</a><br>

        happens after I have reported my find? </font></b><br>
        After you have reported your find to your coroner he or she will instruct 
        you as to which museum or archaeological body you should take the find. 
        If the museum decides that the find is treasure they will inform the British 
        Museum or the National Museum of Wales. If they or a local museum wish 
        the acquire the find, the coroner will hold an inquest to decide whether 
        it is treasure. If declared treasure, the Treasure Valuation Committee 
        will value the find and you would be awarded the full market value for 
        the find. If at any stage the find is not considered Treasure it will 
        be disclaimed and returned to you. If you require information about a 
        specific treasure case being processed by the British Museum, please contact 
        Lisa Voden-Decker, the Treasure Registrar, on 020 7323 8611 or mail to:

        advice do you have for metal detector users?</font></b> <br>
        Always obtain permission from the landowner before using a metal detector 
        on his or her land. Detecting on scheduled ancient monuments is strictly 
        forbidden unless permission has been obtained from English Heritage or 
        in Wales, Cadw. Also be aware that common land owned by your local councils 
        may have bye-laws relating to metal detecting. Metal detectorists are 
        also advised to join a recognised metal detecting club and a national 
        representative body. For more details please contact either the National 
        Council for Metal Detecting (<a href="http://www.ncmd.co.uk" target="_blank">http://www.ncmd.co.uk</a>) 
        or the Federation of Independent Detectorists (<a href="http://www.newbury.net/fid/" target="_blank">http://www.newbury.net/fid/</a>).

        about underwater finds? </b></font><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#000000"><br>
        Under the Merchant Shipping Act (1995) all underwater finds of any date 
        must be reported to the Receiver of Wreck whose job is to decide ownership. 
        In all cases of wreck reported, you may receive a salvage reward. For 
        more information contact the Receiver of Wreck at: Maritime and Coastguard 
        Agency, Spring Place, 105 Commercial Road, Southampton SO15 1EG. Tel.: 
        01703 329474. Fax: 01703 329477. </font></p>

        can I record my finds and discover more about them? </font></b><br>
        All archaeological finds, regardless of whether they are Treasure or not, 
        are important for our nation's heritage. Finders should therefore be aware 
        that all non-treasure finds (e.g. medieval bronze buckles, single coin 
        finds, Prehistoric flints) can be recorded voluntarily under the Portable 
        Antiquities Scheme. </font></p>
      <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#000000">A 
        leaflet about the scheme with a full list of contacts can obtained from 
        the Resource Outreach Officer, c/o Dept. of Coins & Medals, British Museum, 
        London WC1B 3DG. Tel.: 0207 323 8611. Alternatively visit the Portable 
      Antiquities website at: <a href="http://www.finds.org.uk" target="_blank">http://www.finds.org.uk</a>.</font></p>      <p>&nbsp;</p></td>
