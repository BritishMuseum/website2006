            <td width="490" height="100%" valign="top"><p>Around 10,000 plays have been written since the inception of Kabuki, and although many have now disappeared, over 200 classics are still performed. With a dialogue full of puns, double meanings, epigrams and allusion, their content can be classified into two main categories: <em>jidaimono</em> and <em>sewamono</em>. They echo, to some degree, the division of Shakespeare&rsquo;s plays into Histories (including tragedy) and Comedy. These do not necessarily mean funny and serious, rather high society and common society. Moreover, Histories were often a way of disguising contemporary events about important Japanese figures who it was illegal to directly represent on stage. David Farr&rsquo;s play, <em>The UN Inspector</em>, at the National Theatre until 5 October, provides a striking contemporary parallel.</p>
              <p>Generally Kabuki&rsquo;s subject matter would be based around a conflict in which the characters of a play become entangled. This would always move to a logical conclusion that lay within the recognised code of ethics, which governed Edo period society. If a hero transgressed, he would pay with his life. Honour always had to be served.</p>
