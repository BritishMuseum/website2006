              <p>Although Jihei has a devoted wife and children, he falls in love with the prostitute Koharu and cannot bear to part from her. Unfortunately, she is about to go to bed with one of her clients. When his mother comes to announce her anger at the situation, Jihei writes a sworn statement to the effect that he has broken with Koharu forever. But, in fact, he and Koharu have firmly promised to die together for the sake of true love.</p>
              <p>Sensing that something like this might happen, Jihei&rsquo;s wife, Osan, decides to divorce Jihei to prevent such a tragedy. She implores Jihei to go to Koharu immediately and ransom her before she is bought by the other client. Osan offers to sell her clothes and the children's to raise the full amount. But Osan&rsquo;s father believes Jihei is stealing her things to escape with Koharu, and drags her away from her home and children. Later Jihei and Koharu marry, but when they find out that Osan has become a nun Koharu hints to Jihei that she intends to kill herself because of the sorrow she has caused. Jihei, in turn, tells Koharu that he will die with her to atone for his sins against his wife. Thus they walk the road to death together at Amijima. </p>
