<p><strong>African Temperate Zones</strong></p>
<p><em>African desert and semi-desert (or Sahel), including the Sahara to the north, the Kalahari and Namib to the south, and much of Somalia on the Horn of Africa</em></p>
<p>Except in the oases, where rice, date palms and citrus fruits are grown, plants and vegetation are scarce. As a result, the human population (apart from the settled agriculturalists in the oases) tend to be nomadic or &lsquo;transhumant&rsquo; groups such as the Tuareg and Bedouin of the Sahara or the San of the Kalahari, who relocate in different seasons. Besides keeping livestock, survival depends on their knowledge of water-rich and other desert plants, including herbs.</p>
