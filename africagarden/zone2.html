<p><strong>African Tropical Zones</strong></p>
<p><em>Large areas of West, Central, East Africa and Madagascar</em></p>
<p>The rainforest offers the richest and most dense habitat on earth where people can hunt the numerous animals the environment supports, fish in the large rivers such as the Congo, and grow crops such as bananas and yams in clearings where houses are commonly built and roofed from the numerous species of broad-leafed trees. It is also one of the most fragile environments on earth. Once essential plants, trees and the nutrients they provide have been destroyed, the forests are almost impossible to replace.</p>
