<p><strong>African Desert Zones</strong></p>
<p><em>Belts to the north and south of the Sahara, much of the Nile valley and East Africa, and the southern uplands.</em></p>
<p>Herd-grazing peoples as well as settled crop-farmers live in the temperate and savannah regions. Groups such as the Dinka of Sudan combine the two modes of life, removing their cattle up onto the savannah when the Nile is in flood, then bringing them back down as the waters recede to graze on the stalks of millet which are grown and harvested in their absence. Dinka live in circular, wattle and daub huts, thatching their roofs with the same reeds they use to make fish traps. Inside the house, they use gourds from the calabash plant as containers.</p>
