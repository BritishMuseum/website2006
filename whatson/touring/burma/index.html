              This exhibition explores one of the foremost means of artistic expression 
              in Burma - the use of lacquer. It is based on the recent gift to 
              the British Museum of the Ralph and Ruth Isaacs Collection of Burmese 
              Lacquer, but also includes important examples of Burmese lacquer 
              art from the host venues (in Exeter, the magnificent Truscott Buddha 
              image and other Buddhist sculpture and Burmese materials; in Sunderland, 
              vessels, musical instruments and sculpture from museums in Tyne 
              and Wear). This is an opportunity for joint activity between national 
              and regional museums under the Partnership UK scheme and demonstrates 
              the importance of the holdings of regional museums. </font></font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Burma's 
              rich and dramatic culture is almost unknown in Europe. Although 
              it occupies the largest mainland area of Southeast Asia, Burma's 
              political isolation has ensured that its contacts with the rest 
              of the world have been much reduced since it became independent 
              from Britain in 1948.</font></font></p>

              Lacquer - the sap of a tree which is tapped like rubber - can be 
              used in a wide variety of ways and traditionally in Burma almost 
              all parts of life were affected by it. This exhibition highlights 
              a number of the most important areas of lacquer use in Burma, as 
              well as explaining methods of production and of decoration. Especially 
              prominent is its use in the service of Buddhism, not only in the 
              form of sculptures of the Buddha and manuscripts containing the 
              Buddhist dharma and indeed chests to hold them, but also the many 
              different types of vessel which were used for the offering of gifts 
              to monastery and temple. Lacquer, as a heat-proofing agent which 
              also protects against insects, was also widely used in the domestic 
              sphere, and this area is represented in the exhibition as well. 
              Much new research on the subject has been revealed through work 
              preparing the exhibition and its catalogue, such as the use of lacquer 
              vessels in diplomacy, the identification of lacquer masters and 
              their workshops, the translation of the many inscriptions on vessels, 
              and the documentation of contemporary workmanship (a finely decorated 
              five-fold screen was specially commissioned for the exhibition). 
              A short video, shot at Pagan in central Burma, demonstrates the 
              way lacquer vessels are made and decorated. </font></font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Lacquer 
              vessels were produced in an extraordinary array of organic and tactile 
              shapes, in cinnabar red, blazing gold and in lustrous black. In 
              the last two centuries perhaps the most common types were containers 
              for carrying offerings to the monastery (hsun ok) and the cylindrical 
              boxes (kun it) used to hold the paraphernalia for the preparation 
              of the betel quid. This is a small leaf parcel containing tobacco, 
              areca nut, spices, sugar and powdered lime, which is used as a digestive 
              in Burma and other parts of Southeast Asia. </font></font></p>
