            <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The phrase 'The 
              pen is mightier than the sword' expresses a universal recognition 
              of the power of the written word. In Islamic culture, the importance 
              attached to writing stems from the fact that Arabic is both the 
              language of God's revelation to the Prophet in the early 7th century 
              and the script in which it was subsequently written down. This has 
              given the Arabic script a unique significance in Islam. The script 
              has become a defining feature of the material culture of the region 
              we can broadly call the Islamic lands, a vast area that at different 
              times has stretched from Spain in the west to the Malay states and 
              Borneo at the furthest point east.</font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> This exhibition 
              has a number of stories to tell. The objects chosen, about 100 in 
              all drawn principally from the collections of the British Museum, 
              (mainly from the department of Asia and Coins and Medals and with 
              other objects from the Ethnography and Medieval and Modern Europe 
              department) come from all over the Islamic world. Loan loan items 
              include: a section of a Mamluk 14th century Qur'an from the collection 
              of His Excellency Mahdi Al Tajir, sponsor of the exhibition and 
              contemporary works by Ahmed Mustafa and Nassar Mansour who also 
              did the tables of scripts for the exhibition and catalogue.The thread 
              that unites all these objects is that they either have writing inscribed 
              upon them, or they are in some way connected to the art of writing. 
              The theme of the exhibition therefore is to show the development 
              and variations of script and in addition, by looking at what the 
              inscriptions say to open a window onto the culture of a remarkable 
              civilisation that has had so much to offer the cultures it has come 
              into contact with in terms of its scientific, technical and artistic 
              achievements.</font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> The exhibition 
              is divided into eight sections, beginning with 'Islam and the word 
              of God'. Here the religion of Islam is introduced to provide both 
              a sense of the beauty of the script and its spiritual context. 'Beauty 
              and diversity' presents the various kinds of objects that are inscribed 
              and what this writing says; how the forms of Arabic letters change 
              their shape according to time, region and material - paper, a coin, 
              tombstone, metal bowl or ceramic tile. 'Contact with Europe: Arabic 
              script as pattern' examines the fascination in Europe for exotic 
              objects from the Middle-East, as well as how the Arabic script transformed 
              into pattern in Renaissance painting and in pottery from Islamic 
              Spain. Included in 'Islam in China and Indonesia' are objects made 
              for Muslims at the Ming Court, Chinese/Arabic calligraphy, a Javanese 
              textile with Arabic inscriptions, and a group of coins that show 
              the remarkable synthesis that took place in the currencies between 
              the local and imported styles. In 'The art of the calligrapher', 
              the focus is on the practical aspects of calligraphy: pens, pen-boxes 
              and other tools of the trade. In 'Virtuosi scripts on paper', some 
              of the extraordinary skills displayed by calligraphers can be seen. 
              'The contemporary art of writing and calligraphy' includes some 
              dramatic modern examples of the work of a number of Middle-Eastern 
              artists. The final section, 'The power of the word', considers the 
              popular side of Islam with a variety of objects including amulets, 
              standards, magic bowls and popular stickers imbued with amuletic 
              and protective powers.</font></p>

              version of the exhibition will be augmented by items from the collection 
              of the Islamic Arts museum, particularly of South-East Asian Islamic 
              material, and a new version of the catalogue will be produced. </font></p>
