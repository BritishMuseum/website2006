            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">This exhibition 
              is third in the series of collaborations between The British Museum 
              and the Henry Moore Institute. It not intended to be a comprehensive 
              survey of masks but a small selection of choice examples which will 
              illustrate the ways in which masks and masquerading have been used 
              in diverse cultures and diverse periods. </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">By selecting 
              examples across the breadth of The British Museum's collections 
              it will give the visitor the rare opportunity to compare a mask 
              from Ancient Egypt directly with one from Japan or from 17th century 
              England. The chosen examples fall into simple, opposing categories 
              such as life and death, male and female, human and divine, ritual 
              and theatrical, conceal and reveal which either confirm or confound 
              our pre-conceptions about masks. The word &quot;mask&quot; has become 
              a generic term. In most - but not all - cases, it means something 
              worn by humans to cover the face during a festival or ceremony as 
              a part of a headdress or an overall ensemble, though it has also 
              come to mean just about any depiction of the human face. Although 
              many masks are imaginative depictions or idealized portraits, the 
              wax death-mask of Oliver Cromwell displayed in the exhibition, is 
              a very exact portrait of a historical figure. </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In the West, 
              masks are often associated with disguise or protection, such as 
              the Ribchester cavalry sports helmet which has a visor in the form 
              of a face. Masks are also widely used as a dramatic device such 
              as in the Japanese No theatre tradition where they were worn by 
              a male actor to represent a specific character, whose representation 
              remained the same for hundreds of years. The mask can also be a 
              vehicle for transformation so that the wearer can become a demon 
              or a deity such as the gilded Egyptian mummy mask which symbolized 
              the deceased becoming divine and the Devil dancer mask from Sri 
              Lanka which was used to exorcise evil spirits from the sick and 
              inflicted. Other masks represent a form of human transformation 
              and include those worn by the Sande society during female initiation 
              rites in which a girl became a woman. Sande masks illustrate a very 
              specific form of idealised female beauty and are the only example 
              of women making and wearing masks in Africa. </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Masks do not 
              necessary follow the size or form of the human head, such as the 
              wooden king mask from Bamum in the Cameroons which is so large to 
              emphasise and impress upon the viewer the power and might of the 
              ruler wearing it. Some masks were never intended to be worn and 
              could exist as deities in their own right. The mask from Teotihuacan, 
              for example, is carved stone and thus very heavy with no eyeholes 
              so it was probably used as the face of a composite sculpture of 
              a god. Another example of a mask that was not worn, by humans anyway, 
              originates from New Guinea and figured in ceremonies associated 
              with the cult of the Yam. However, masks are not always of the human 
              face. In the North West Coast of America wolves, bears and owls 
              were depicted and when worn evoked the bravery or wisdom of the 
              wearer's ancestors.</font></p>
