      <p><font face="Arial, Verdana, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3" color="#666666"><b>Sir 
        Hans Sloane</b></font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Sloane was born in 
        Killyleagh, Ireland in relatively modest circumstances. Inspired by a 
        childhood interest in natural history, he studied medicine in London and 
        France. It was said of him by William Stukeley, the antiquary, that he 
        was &quot;an instance of the great power of industry which can advance 
        a man to a considerable height in the world's esteem with moderate parts 
        & learning...&quot;</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">His career as a collector 
        really began when in 1687, as personal physician, he accompanied the new 
        Governor, the Duke of Albermarle, to Jamaica, having concluded that study 
        of exotic flora and fauna would be of use in his career. Sloane's expectations 
        were fulfilled and he collected some 800 species of plants and other live 
        specimens to bring back to London. An account of his travels was published 
        in 1707 and 1725.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">On his return to London 
        in 1689 Sloane set up a successful medical practice at his home in No. 
        3 Bloomsbury Place - coincidentally just along the street from the present 
        Museum building. He had a good bedside manner, accumulated wealthy and 
        aristocratic patients among them Queen Anne and Kings George I and II, 
        but also participated in charitable work. Although not in the first rank 
        intellectually, he was something of an innovator. He promoted inoculation 
        against smallpox, the use of quinine and the health-giving properties 
        of drinking chocolate mixed with milk. He became President of the College 
        of Physicians in 1719 and in 1727 succeeded Sir Isaac Newton as President 
        of the Royal Society.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In 1695 he married 
        Elizabeth Langley, widow of Fulk Rose of Jamaica. Sloane and his wife 
        had two surviving daughters, Sarah who married George Stanley of Paultons, 
        Hampshire and Elizabeth who became Lady Cadogan. He was created a Baronet 
        in 1716.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">He absorbed complete 
        collections made by others, among them William Charlton (Courten) (1642-1702) 
        and James Petiver (d.1718) and also received objects from friends and 
        patients. One wit called him &quot;the foremost toyman of his time&quot;. 
        His collection thus outgrew the house at No. 3 Bloomsbury Place and Sloane 
        was obliged to purchase No. 4. In 1742 he moved with his collections to 
        a manor house he had bought at Chelsea. His time there is still commemorated 
        by such place names as 'Sloane Square' and 'Hans Crescent'.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Sloane died at the 
        age of 93 in 1753 and was buried at Chelsea Old Church. His collection 
        then amounted to some 71,000 objects. In addition to a preponderance of 
        natural history specimens, the collection included 1,125 &quot;things 
        relating to the customs of ancient times or antiquities&quot; and 23,000 
        coins and medals. There were also 50,000 books, prints and manuscripts, 
        together with a herbarium. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">A group of Trustees 
        was appointed under the terms of his will to oversee the distribution 
        of the collection which was left in the first instance to King George 
        II for the nation. Following the intervention of Parliament, Sloane's 
        collection was acquired on payment of &pound;20,000 to his two daughters 
        and became the nucleus of the British Museum. </font></p>
