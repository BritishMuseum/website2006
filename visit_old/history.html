      <p><font face="Arial, Verdana, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3" color="#666666"><b>The 
        History of The British Museum</b></font></p>
      <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The origins of the 
        British Museum lie in the will of the physician, naturalist and collector, 
        Sir Hans Sloane (1660-1753). Not wishing to see his collection of some 
        71,000 objects, a library and herbarium, dispersed on his death, Sloane 
        bequeathed it to King George II for the nation in return for the payment 
        of &pound;20,000 to his heirs. Should the bequest be refused the collection 
        was to be offered to learned academies overseas. A large and influential 
        group of Trustees was charged with overseeing the disposition of his estate. 
        The King had little interest but Parliament, led by the Speaker, Arthur 
        Onslow, was persuaded to accept the gift and an Act of Parliament establishing 
        the British Museum received the royal assent on 7 June 1753. This directed 
        that a public lottery should be held to raise funds for the purchase and 
        the acquisition of a repository. The Cotton collection of manuscripts, 
        given to the nation in 1700, was attached to the new museum and &pound;</font><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">10,000 
        was expended on the purchase of the Harleian collection of manuscripts. 
        A new Board of Trustees was established.</font> </p>
      <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> The foundation collections 
        largely consisted of books, manuscripts and natural history with some 
        antiquities (including coins and medals, prints and drawings) and ethnography. 
        In 1757 King George II donated the 'Old Royal Library' of the sovereigns 
        of England and with it the privilege of copyright receipt. The Museum 
        was first housed in a 17th-century mansion, Montagu House, in Bloomsbury 
        on the site of today's building. On 15 January 1759 the British Museum 
        opened to the public. With the exception of two World Wars, when parts 
        of the collection were evacuated, it has remained open ever since, gradually 
        increasing its opening hours and moving from an attendance of perhaps 
        5,000 a year to today's 5 million. </font> 
      <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">From its beginnings 
        the British Museum was a new type of institution. Governed by a body of 
        Trustees responsible to Parliament, its collections belonged to the nation, 
        and admission was free and open to all. Entry was directed to be given 
        to 'all studious and curious Persons' and thus throughout the Museum's 
        history public enjoyment has been linked with scholarship and education. 
        From the first a Reading Room was provided in which scholars could consult 
        the library and learned staff were engaged to curate and catalogue the 
        collections. The first students' room, that of Prints & Drawings, opened 
        in 1808.</font> 
      <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> The first antiquities 
        of note, Sir William Hamilton's collection of Greek vases and other classical 
        objects, were purchased in 1772. These were followed by such notable acquisitions 
        as the Rosetta Stone and other antiquities from Egypt (1802), the Townley 
        collection of classical sculpture (1805), the sculptures of the Parthenon, 
        known as the Elgin Marbles (1816). With the additional expansion of the 
        natural history collections and the library, Montagu House was rapidly 
        outgrown. In 1823 the gift to the nation by George IV of his father's 
        library (the King's Library) provided the catalyst for the construction 
        of today's quadrangular building designed by Sir Robert Smirke (1780-1867). 
        The first phase was largely completed in 1852, to be followed by the round 
        Reading Room, designed by Robert's brother Sydney (1798-1877) erected 
        in the central courtyard in 1854-7.</font> 
      <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The 19th century was 
        a time of popular expansion. Earlier restrictions on access were swept 
        away and, particularly on public holidays, the Museum attracted great 
        crowds of all ages and social classes. While the scholarly work continued 
        with the publication of the Museum's great series of learned catalogues, 
        many curators took an interest in broadening the Museum's appeal through 
        lectures and improved display. The first popular Synopsis (or guide) to 
        the collections was published in 1808 and ran to over sixty editions before 
        splitting into more detailed illustrated guide books by the end of the 
        century. The Museum was much involved in excavation abroad. Its Assyrian 
        collections formed the basis for the decipherment of cuneiform just as 
        the Rosetta Stone, made available to earlier scholars, had resulted in 
        the unlocking of Egyptian hieroglyphic script. The appointment in 1851 
        of Sir Augustus Wollaston Franks (1826-97) led to a vast expansion into 
        such fields as British and European prehistory and other material, ethnography, 
        oriental art and archaeology.</font> 
      <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> In the 1880s the 
        natural history collections were moved to a new building in South Kensington, 
        later to become the Natural History Museum. This departure and the construction 
        of the White Wing (fronting Montague Street) for some time absorbed the 
        increasing collections. King Edward VII's Galleries, formally opened in 
        1914, the Duveen Gallery (1939/62) and the New Wing (1978) provided additional 
        public facilities, offices, display areas and library storage. This, however, 
        did not solve the Museum's lack of space and proposals continued to be 
        made for a further transfer of collections.</font> 
      <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> The Department of 
        Ethnography moved out temporarily to Burlington Gardens (now closed) in 
        1970. In 1973 the library departments became part of a new organisation, 
        the British Library, leaving Bloomsbury for a new building at St Pancras 
        in 1998. </font> 
      <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The 20th century, 
        particularly the second half, saw a great expansion in public services. 
        The first summary guide was published in 1903 and a sales counter was 
        introduced in 1912. The first guide lecturer was appointed in 1911. There 
        was something of a hiatus because of two wars and under-funding but a 
        full time exhibition designer was appointed in 1964 followed by an active 
        programme of gallery refurbishment. An education service was set up in 
        1970 and a publishing company in 1973.</font> 
      <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> This public expansion 
        is reflected in the opening in 2000 of The Queen Elizabeth II Great Court, 
        which was created in part of the space vacated by the Library. At the 
        centre is the restored Reading Room, now open to the general public, which 
        houses the Paul Hamlyn Library and COMPASS, a multi-media database of 
        the collections. Beneath are the Clore Education Centre and the Sainsbury 
        African galleries.</font>
