      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In 1997 a Greek sanctuary 
        site, first excavated by Charles Newton in 1857-9, was rediscovered in 
        the ruins of the ancient city of Cnidus, S.W. Asia Minor. The British 
        Museum had acquired a quantity of Hellenistic sculpture from the old excavation, 
        and recent rediscovery of the sanctuary site was an important event in 
        the modern understanding of this sculpture. The excitement of finding 
        the site, which had remained lost and all but forgotten since Newton's 
        time, prompted the suggestion that the British Museum re-excavate it. 
        </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The offer was made 
        by Professor Ramaxan &Ouml;zgan of the University of Konya in Turkey, 
        who with colleagues and students has himself excavating at Cnidus since 
        1988. The British Museum excavation is run in partnership with our Turkish 
        colleagues. The Museum side is funded largely by the Townley Group, and 
        there have so far been one short survey season in 1999 and three very 
        successful excavation seasons, 2000-2002. One more summer season is planned 
        for 2003. </font></p>

        <i>Discovering ancient Afghanistan</i><br>
        </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">From 1833-37 Charles 
        Masson (alias James Lewis) was employed by the British East India Company 
        in Afghanistan. Initially his brief was to explore the ancient sites, 
        but after 1835, when his true identity as a deserter from the Company's 
        army was revealed, he was forced to work also as a British 'newswriter' 
        or spy, in return for an official pardon. He amassed a huge collection 
        of coins from the site of Begram, near Kabul, and recorded or excavated 
        about 50 Buddhist monuments in the Kabul-Jalalabad region. When the Company's 
        India Museum closed in 1878, many of the Buddhist finds and some of the 
        coins were transferred, without documentation, to the British Museum. 
        The bulk of the coins were sold at auction, but the residue of some 10,000 
        coins (including over 6,000 from the Masson's collection), were uncovered 
        in the India Office Library in 1995, and transferred on permanent loan 
        to the British Museum. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Masson Project 
        evolved from the realisation that Masson's own detailed, illustrated records 
        survive, principally in the India Office Collections of the British Library. 
        These are being used to identify and document the finds in his collection, 
        and also to produce an archive of all his records of the archaeological 
        sites, many of which no longer exist. Townley support for the Project 
        over the past five years has, among other things, provided a selection 
        of 112 photographs of Masson's sketches and plans of these sites for the 
        archive. Work continues on identifying and cataloguing the Masson material 
        in the Museums' own collection and conserving, sorting and registering 
        the coins in the India Office loan collection. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Opened on 12 September 
        2002 and running until 9 January 2003 the exhibition <i>Discovering Ancient 
        Afghanistan: The Masson Collection</i>, in Gallery 69a. Benefiting from 
        research undertaken for the Masson Project, this brings together Masson's 
        finds with his archaeological record and illustrations of the sties, for 
        the first time since he sent the collections to the East India Company 
        in the 1830s.</font></p>

        <i>Discovering Roman Shipwrecks</i></font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Fishermen who work 
        the waters of Herne Bay off Kent have for centuries been finding Roman 
        pottery in their nets that comes from the wreck of a Roman ship. Scholars 
        have collected and studied this pottery since the 18th century (Charles 
        Townley himself collected many of the vessels), but the wreck of the Roman 
        ship has never been found. Indeed, no Roman shipwreck has ever been found 
        in the waters around Britain.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The British Museum, 
        working with the University of Southampton, began a three-year project 
        to locate this Roman shipwreck in 2000-2001. Funding from the Townley 
        Group and the British Museum has enabled us to survey a large area of 
        the seabed (covering 28 square kilometres) and send divers down to check 
        more than 80 possible targets. The divers have found pottery on the seabed 
        that must come from the wreck, enabling us to narrow down where to search 
        to a much smaller area. More work in 2002 and 2003 will use a new technological 
        breakthrough made by the University of Southampton that allows archaeologists 
        to look beneath the seabed to find wrecks buried in the sand. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">We are also creating 
        a detailed catalogue of all the pottery that fishermen have recovered 
        from the wreck in order to gain a better picture of what Roman cargo coming 
        to Britain contained. We have already tracked down more than 350 complete 
        vessels from the wreck in museums across the country. This is a large 
        enough sample to tell us much about the cargo, and to suggest that it 
        must have originally contained thousands of vessels. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In the final year 
        of the project we hope to complete our surveys to locate the wreck and 
        also complete our study of the existing pottery from the wreck ready for 
        publication and public representation. </font></p>

      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Many of the finest 
        objects in the British collections came to The British Museum through 
        Treasure Trove. In recent times, archaeologists from the Museum have assisted 
        in the recovery of material and made records of the site and precise context 
        of the find. Older discoveries were simply brought to London and the sites 
        remained mysterious spots on the map, awaiting proper exploration. This 
        project is revisiting several sites where important archaeological material 
        was found. The intention is to record the sites and findspots with far 
        more precision and to explore their wider context in the landscape. Several 
        smaller Museum-sponsored projects are included, and the assistance of 
        the Townley group ensures that more extensive research and fieldwork is 
        done beyond the absolutely necessary recovery of treasure.</font></p>

        This remarkable treasure site found in 2001-2, contains several discrete

        helmet. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Townley support for 
        these projects means that The British Museum can respond quickly and effectively 
        to new Treasure sites and explore the old. Partnerships with British colleagues 
        ensure that sites are fully researched and finds are interpreted in fully 
        understood archaeological contexts. This will make the museum displays 
        of the future much more interesting and relevant. The importance of Treasure 
        at the British Museum is demonstrated in 2003 by the major exhibition, 
        <i>Treasure: Finding our past</i>, and the BBC's programme series about 
        the British Museum's Treasure work.</font></p>

        <i>The original architectural plans for the British Museum</i></font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The 'Smirke Plans' 
        are the architectural plans and drawings commissioned by the Trustees 
        of the British Museum from three successive and distinguished museum architects: 
        George Saunders (1762-1839), Sir Robert Smirke (1780-1867) and Sydney 
        Smirke (1798-1877). These important public records, part of the National 
        Archive, chart the development of the Museum site from c.1803 to c.1867, 
        showing the progress of the Museum building from the first extension, 
        Saunders' Townley Gallery, through Sir Robert Smirke's spectacular neo-classical 
        quadrangular building, to Sydney Smirke's famous Round Reading Room. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The project is primarily 
        one of conservation as the drawings, which are exquisite, have suffered 
        much wear and tear over the years. Since the 1930s the drawings, of which 
        there are approximately four hundred, have been mounted and bound within 
        five large, unwieldy albums, now held within the Museum Archive Store 
        Room. Although the albums have provided some protection to the drawings, 
        this method of guarding has made them particularly vulnerable to handling 
        and, in the past, many of the drawings have suffered. Therefore, access 
        is now restricted and for reasons of conservation and security they have 
        been microfilmed. However, this medium is unable to convey their quality 
        and content. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">This project will 
        enable the Museum to secure the future preservation of the 'Smirke Plans' 
        and enable this internationally acknowledged rich historical and architectural 
        resource to be accessed by a much wider audience. It would also provide 
        an opportunity to undertake a systematic photographic record of the conserved 
        plans and drawings in preparation for future digitisation projects. Therefore, 
        public access would be improved on two levels: the originals, conserved 
        and freed from the constraints of the bound volumes, would be readily 
        available for temporary exhibition here and at outside venues; the reproduced 
        images would be available to the widest possible audience (as an experiment, 
        a small selection of these images may now be viewed through '<a href="compass/">COMPASS</a>').

        required. To date, we have raised &pound;13,000 and we are extremely hopeful

      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In the summer of 2000, 
        excavations near a mausoleum uncovered part of a cremation tomb dating 
        to the time of Julius Caesar (c.50 BC) filled with pottery, metal objects 
        and fragments of a decorated funerary couch. The tomb itself was obviously 
        of someone important (funerary couches burnt with the body are rare - 
        and it could be that the adjacent monument commemorates the deceased). 
        Very importantly, it is the earliest structure we have identified from 
        our excavations. Could we now be looking at the monument of one of the 
        founding fathers of the Municipium of Forum Novum?</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Subsequent Georadar 
        scans revealed the nearby mausoleum to be a major monument, the focal 
        point of a large triangular area, delineated by substantial walls bounding 
        both the baths and the villa. The mausoleum is placed in a large exedra, 
        a semicircular enclosure. Only a few weeks after this exciting development 
        we received the shocking news that someone had completely razed the remains 
        of the mausoleum. We cannot yet be sure what damage has been done to the 
        cremation tomb and other areas.</font></p>

        shall continue uncovering the important late Roman levels behind the church

        <i>Decoding Nasca iconography</i></font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The huge figures drawn 
        on the desert landscape of the Nasca Valley in southern Peru nearly 2,000 
        years ago are one of the world's great archaeological puzzles. The British 
        Museum's collection of more than 300 extraordinary Nasca pottery vessels 
        is a key part of a project that is starting to unravel the significance 
        of these striking works of art. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In the second year 
        we have completed the photography and rollout drawings of our vessels 
        and moved on to record the collections held in Oxford (Pitt-Rivers Museum), 
        Cambridge (Museum of Archaeology and Anthropology), Ipswich and Manchester, 
        as well as an important collection in Gothenburg, Sweden. We are steadily 
        building up an archive of sufficient range and depth to undertake a full 
        iconographic analysis. We now have drawings of some 250 objects, each 
        taking from three to six hours to draw depending on the complexity of 
        the iconography. The Townley Group has helped cover the costs of the detailed 
        photography required and enabled us to engage Garth Denning, a specialised 
        graphic artist, to make roll-out drawings based on the photo collages 
        created for each vessel. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Next year we will 
        begin recording the key Nasca collections held by museums in Stuttgart, 
        Munich, Berlin, Zurich and Madrid. These are essential in order to compile 
        an inventory of a representative range of figures, symbols and motifs, 
        which will form the basis for reconstructing the Nasca pantheon in its 
        entirety. This will form the basis for a future exhibition and also form 
        part of the Virtual Museum in Action, which is designed to introduce a 
        much broader audience to one of the most fascinating cultures in the Precolumbian 
        Americas. </font></p>

        <i>Conserving a body of violent evidence</i></font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Wendorf Collection 
        of 61 skeletons from the Sudan, dating to 10-12,000 BC, has recently been 
        acquired by the British Museum and appears to represent the earliest known 
        evidence of warfare. To date no detailed study of this very important 
        collection has been possible - concretions of soil and other deposits 
        and previous attempts at restoration are obscuring detail, preventing 
        analysis and oesteological study. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Conservation work 
        will allow vital evidence to be revealed. Cleaning will uncover for the 
        first time the full evidence of cut injuries to the bones. The resins, 
        adhesives and fillers, which were applied soon after the excavation in 
        the 1960s in an attempt to repair the broken bones and skulls, have now 
        discoloured and collapsed. By removing these, joining the broken bones 
        and re-constructing the skulls accurately and with materials, which will 
        not degrade over time, a wide range of analysis and study will be possible. 
        This unique collection will at last be able to tell its story of the lifestyle, 
        health and apparently violent deaths of a people from the distant past. 
        </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The support of the 
        Townley Group will allow investigative work on a small sample of the collection 
        to be carried out, which can then form the basis of a rolling programme, 
        subject to further funding. </font></p>

        <i>Recording historical data and documenting change</i></font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Arunachal Pradesh 
        in the far northeast of India has been little documented, mostly on account 
        of political instability over the last 100 years. The Arunachal Project 
        linking the Museum with SOAS and both with institutions in India, is concerned 
        to record historical data (some of which is in UK institutions), as well 
        as to document change in this remote tribal region. The Project aims to: 
        one - record religious traditions, especially in the north and west of 
        the state where Tibetan culture flourishes, two - add to the Department 
        of Oriental Antiquities' contemporary collections and three - study the 
        background, often dense with meaning, for objects in the collections which 
        were acquired in the past without context.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The overall project 
        has been awarded an ESRC grant for five years to support basic costs, 
        for example, international flights, post-doctoral research fellowships, 
        library costs, for UK and Indian participants. However, what we particularly 
        lack at present is money to cover the costs of collecting, and it is for 
        this essential element for which the Townley Group would provide support. 
        The amount requested of &pound;4,500 would be used as follows: &pound;1,500, 
        collecting of contemporary religious materials, especially where context 
        can be recorded; &pound;1,000, special transport to enable visiting remote 
        parts; &pound;1,000 interpreter costs, once you move beyond the reach 
        of Hindi, the need for local languages becomes important; &pound;1,000 
        Packing and transport costs for the collection from Arunachal Pradesh 
        to London.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In February the generous 
        support of the British Museum Friends enabled a brief reconnaissance trip. 
        With the help of the Townley Group the hope is to now move to the next 
        stage of the project.</font></p>

      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Ashurbanipal, King 
        of Assyria 668-627 BC, himself a trained scholar, devoted much effort 
        to ensuring that his Royal Library in Nineveh contained as up-to-date 
        and extensive a collection of cuneiform literature as possible. Where 
        manuscripts were lacking he commandeered them from libraries in Babylonia 
        to the south. These documents, in tricky Babylonian script, were recopied 
        in the Palace chancery by the best scribes in the country. His library, 
        now in the British Museum, contained about 25,000 tablets of all sorts.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">We know there are 
        about 3,500 Babylonian tablets from Nineveh. Our project will re-examine 
        this corpus to establish exactly which compositions are involved and which 
        of them can be identified as reflecting Ashurbanipal's collecting activities.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">This project is now 
        particularly timely. The Iraqi Ministry of Higher Education and Research 
        has approached the British Museum for practical support in developing 
        a new Institute at Mosul dedicated to the development of Iraqi Assyriology 
        with a particular focus on the study of Ashurbanipal's Library. The Museum 
        is publicly committed to responding positively by providing replicas and 
        academic support. We hope that this policy will help to reduce the risk 
        of future restitution claims. Our project fits centrally within this programme.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">We would like to ask 
        the Townley Group for support to employ a post-doctoral Assyriologist 
        for a period of up to six months to work with us on this project. </font></p>
