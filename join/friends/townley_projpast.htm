      <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The Contemporary Arts 
        and Culture Programme is an exciting initiative that aims to demonstrate 
        that the artefacts in the British Museum are not only documents that tell 
        us about the past, but also a powerful source of creative inspiration. 
        An important objective is to attract a wider audience, especially among 
        young adults, by collaborating with other organizations.<br>
        Contributions from the Townley Group were crucial for a number of significant 
        projects. We continued the SciArt project <i>'Eternal Artefact'?</i></font> 
        <font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">which involved the 
        Portuguese artist Joao Penalva and the Conservation Department. In January 
        2001, to mark the inaugural exhibition in the Hotung Gallery, we held 
        a one-day conference, <i>'Human Image Right Now'!</i>. The panel discussion 
        was chaired by art critic Sacha Craddock and involved artists Antony Gormley, 
        Sarah Lucas and Gavin Turk, as well as dancer/choreographer Michael Clark, 
        who is researching gesture in sculpture during his residency at the Museum. 
        In May 2001, a sell-out performance called <i>An Evening with Tracey Emin 
        </i>was staged to accompany the exhibition <i>Cleopatra</i>. In September 
        2001, as part of <i>Japan 2001</i>, the Japanese dancer Michiyo Sato celebrated 
        Isadora Duncan's inspiration from the Parthenon sculptures.<br>
        We are working with the Henry Moore Institute on a new outreach initiative 
        to display objects from our collections in Leeds. The highly successful 
        exhibition <i>The Sculpted Word</i> (June-September 2001) was followed 
        in December 2001 by <i>Unidentified Museum Objects</i>, which focused 
        on works that have generated curiosity and speculation. In association 
        with the Arts Council, we collaborated with designer Tom Dixon as part 
        of a major international conference which was held in February 2002.</font></p>

        Technique </font></p>
      <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The pilot phase of 
        this project showed that the approach we used to identify methods of engraving 
        Mesopotamian cylinder seals can be successfully applied to carved Chinese 
        jade. It has been possible to make moulds in dental wax not only of fully 
        exposed surfaces, but also of the hidden 'internal' surfaces of deeply 
        carved details. These surfaces would have been difficult to finish and 
        polish, and often retain valuable information. Examining the moulds at 
        high magnification reveals characteristic features, from which we can 
        interpret the methods used by ancient artisans.<br>
        We have shown that tool marks are commonly present on jade artefacts from 
        the Neolithic to the modern era. Whilst sharply pointed tools may sometimes 
        have been used, evidence for chipping or flaking (seen on many cylinder 
        seals) has not been found on jade. Instead, the marks suggest the use 
        of abrasive tools, including handheld saws, files and rubbers, rotary 
        drills and, on later pieces, the jeweller's wheel. Because nephrite jade 
        is such an exceptionally tough material, it is likely that chipping would 
        not have been successful.<br>
        We were seeking support to study jades from the Early Dynasties and early 
        Imperial China, a period that may have witnessed the introduction of the 
        jeweller's wheel. Our interpretations will be supported by experiments 
        to replicate the tool marks observed on the artefacts. The findings will 
        have relevance for dating and authenticity, complementing stylistic approaches, 
        and will provide us with new insights into the influence that technology 
        may have had on style in the carving of Chinese jade.</font></p>

      <p><i><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>A Screen on 
        Screen</b></font></i></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> The Museum is fortunate 
        to have a remarkable six-fold screen painted by the early nineteenth-century 
        Japanese artist Utagawa Toyharu. The scene depicts courtesans and their 
        apprentices gathered together in a room in the famous Tamaya House in 
        the Yoshiwara pleasure quarter of the city of Edo. However, the condition 
        of this unique screen had been causing concern for some time. The Department 
        of Conservation was therefore delighted when master restorer Mitsuhiro 
        Abe was able to include the screen in his programme of conservation of 
        work during 1998.<br>
        The Sumitomo Foundation has generously funded the restoration project 
        as well as the recording of the conservation process on video. Support 
        of the Townley Group made possible to turn this video record into a film 
        that illuminates for the general public the painstaking and skilled work 
        of conservation. With the addition of historical and archival footage 
        from Japan, and with professional editing, we can tell the fascinating 
        story of this magnificent screen and show how the Museum is preserving 
        objects for future generations to enjoy.</font></p>

        Senneferi at Luxor </b></i></font></p>
      <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Without the support 
        of the Townley Group in 1999, the expedition to this important tomb would 
        not have achieved the impressive results that were gained from the initial 
        sorting and evaluation of excavation material. Sub-projects included the 
        conservation of papyrus and textiles, the study of the wonderful assemblage 
        of pottery from the burial of Senneferi, and the coffins of the various 
        families who re-used the tomb between 1050 and 600 BC.<br>
        A second frenetic month of investigation completed the study of the pottery, 
        with numerous large and small vessels reconstructed and documented. An 
        unexpected discovery was several attractive cartonnage mummy-cases of 
        two or three generations of people who used the tomb in the 22nd dynasty. 
        The papyri and textiles in the tomb were almost completely conserved. 
        Extensive photographic documentation was made, and many details of the 
        scenes and architecture checked. <br>
        Although we are not able to take the finds out of Egypt, all the objects 
        in the tomb complement and enhance comparable material in the British 
        Museum, which often does not have precise provenance, and enable more 
        exact dating to take place. It is now only a matter of a short season 
        to complete the study of the human remains in the tomb, and to tie up 
        various loose ends. <br>
        The Townley Group made it possible for the excavation of this fascination 
        monument to be completed.</font></p>

        Images of Power on Ancient Coins</b> </i></font></p>
      <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Identifiable statues 
        of the historical characters of antiquity are rare and few paintings have 
        survived. The finest portraits of many of the great kings and emperors 
        of the ancient Greek and Roman worlds are to be found on their coins. 
        Alexander the Great's face was instantly recognizable everywhere in the 
        world known to the ancient Greeks, and highly influential in the power-struggles 
        of his Greek successors. Later, powerful Romans such as Pompey, Julius 
        Caesar, Mark Antony and Augustus not only sought to emulate Alexander's 
        world-conquests, but also modelled their careers and public images on 
        his. The gold and silver coins produced with superb skill by anonymous 
        craftsmen have given us wonderfully evocative portraits of these individuals 
        and helped their fame to survive the test of time.<br>
        Drawing on its own unrivalled collections, recently supplemented by the 
        C.A. Hersh bequest of 8,000 Greek and Roman coins, the spring exhibition 
        of the Department of Coins and Medals reveals the obsession with public 
        image among the rulers of the ancient world. <br>
        The Townley Group sponsored a series of lectures that enabled renowned 
        experts to explore these themes further:</font></p>

      <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">When the Department 
        of Conservation had the opportunity to record on film the conservation 
        of the Museum's remarkable painted screen by Utagawa Toyoharu, it seemed 
        just too good a chance to miss. Courtesans of the Tamaya House provided 
        the perfect combination of a lavish painting, intriguing art history and 
        a fascinating conservation process.<br>
        Since its release in March 2001, the video <i>Secrets of the Screen</i> 
        has attracted an enormous amount of interest, and has been enthusiastically 
        received by a wide variety of audiences. Importantly, it has managed to 
        achieve a successful balance between entertainment and education. It is 
        now on sale in England and America and has been shown in schools, colleges 
        and universities. The Department of Conservation is very grateful to the 
        Townley Group for its contribution towards this important project.<br>
        The response to <i>Secrets of the Screen</i> has been such that the Department 
        is now considering producing a series, provisionally titled <i>Hands on 
        History</i>, which would be broadcast on television internationally. We 
        are currently negotiating with a distributor, which would enable us to 
        maximise global exposure and recoup production costs. The titles under 
        development are <i>Anglo-Saxon Gold: The Sutton Hoo Treasure</i>, <i>Egypt 
        and Eternity: The Conservation of Egyptian Antiquities</i>, and <i>The 
        Spirit of Papuya: The Conservation of Oceanic Gulf Artefacts</i>. This 
        is a wonderful opportunity to show a wide audience the behind-the-scenes 
        work of the Department and illustrate how well the British Museum cares 
        for its collections. The Townley Group contributors provided invaluable 
        support for this exciting work.</font></p>

        Instruments Accessible</font></p>
      <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">There is no doubt 
        that scientific instruments are among those objects most difficult to 
        explain in a few words on a gallery label. However, in recent years we 
        have tried to make the British Museum's fine collections more accessible 
        to people of all backgrounds. The 1998 exhibition <i>Humphrey Cole: Mint, 
        Measurement and Maps in Elizabethan England</i>, which was supported by 
        the Townley Group, has had considerable influence on public appreciation 
        of these instruments and their context. The exhibition was followed by 
        instrument-focused gallery talks and behind-the-scenes visits for the 
        general public and Friends. The response has been hugely encouraging and 
        shows how important it is for curators to share their enthusiasm for the 
        objects and communicate personally, rather than just through the written 
        word. We want to make it possible for the casual visitor to have this 
        kind of experience without needing to book a visit at a specific time. 
        Our aim is to have a trolley-table in the gallery, on which to show replica 
        instruments along with a range of informative material. Specially trained 
        volunteers will staff the project, which is aimed at the general public, 
        as well as at visually impaired visitors, and will offer the opportunity 
        to touch, handle and explore this exciting group of objects. The set-up 
        will be very versatile and could be used for events in other locations 
        or for specific audiences. We are asking for funds to purchase a range 
        of replica-instruments made by the renowned Swiss instruments-maker Martin 
        Brunold; a trolley-table and folding chairs; an angle-poise lamp and a 
        magnifying glass; signing and information material; and a comments book.</font></p>
