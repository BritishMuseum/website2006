        was established in 1989 in recognition of the British Museum∆s global 
        importance. With hundreds of donors, including members, foundations, and 
        corporate supporters, it is one of the most critical sources of financial 
        and other support for the Museum. </font> 
      <p><font face="Arial, Verdana, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">AFBM has 
        raised approximately $30 million since its founding to support a variety 
        of Museum-related projects, including exhibitions, acquisitions, education 
        programs and the Great Court, to which it has thus far contributed approximately 
        $20 million.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial, Verdana, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> AFBM maintains 
        a professional staff in New York and an active board of directors from 
        around the United States. Together, they oversee its promotional, educational 
        and fundraising activities. In January 1990, the Internal Revenue Service 
        ruled that AFBM qualifies as a charitable organization, as described in 
        Section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code. Accordingly, contributions 
        and bequests made to AFBM, which may be in the form of checks, securities, 
        works of art, and so on, are deductible for U.S. income and estate tax 
        purposes, as provided by law. </font>
      <p><font face="Arial, Verdana, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">American 
        Friends hosts a lively schedule of lectures and events in New York, and 
        select U.S. cities, for members and the public at large. It offers several 
        categories of membership with attractive benefits designed to keep members 
        in close touch with The British Museum. </font>
