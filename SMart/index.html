        This series of paintings by socially-excluded artists reflects some of 
        the themes of the Wellcome Trust Gallery, a new permanent display that 
        will open here in autumn 2003. It will explore the different ways in which 
        people create and ensure well-being and safeguard their passage through 
        life. The display has been produced in partnership with the SMart Network, 
        which is dedicated to changing the lives of socially excluded people. 
        It promotes works of art by socially excluded artists in order to provide 
        them with a route back to mainstream life, and to offer them the support 
        and opportunities necessary for them to regain their independence and 
        self-esteem. <br>
        <br>
        The artists: <br>
        William Denison Ian Hughes <br>
        Anthony Anderson <br>
        David Walsh <br>
        Peter Swann <br>
        Stuart Jackson <br>
        <br>
        Some of the artists have painted objects that will be in the new gallery 
        or that are already in galleries nearby. The paintings of Ian Hughes are 
        inspired by a Japanese kite, seen sailing through fantastical landscapes. 
        Peter Swan depicts a costumed shaman and a dramatic Sri Lankan snake mask. 
        The same snake mask appears in some of David Walsh's work, often set in 
        unusual contexts, and related to a variety of traditions of healing. Anthony 
        Anderson paints a magnificent Easter Island statue, as well as more Sri 
        Lankan masks, this time, in his own words, with 'an almost clown-like 
        appearance, wonderful bright colours and big eyes'. Others have based 
        their paintings on their own thoughts about health and well-being. Stuart 
        Jackson's series of five paintings are inspired by the importance of balance 
        to the achievement of well-being. At the centre of his work is a Native 
        North American mask, flanked by masked male and female figures and representations 
        of religious buildings. William Denison portrays a Papua New Guinean framed 
        by a beautiful landscape, while Walsh's 'The Archer' depicts a figure 
        in perfect harmony with his environment. </font><br>
